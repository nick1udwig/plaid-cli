#### `/investments/holdings/get`

#### Get Investment holdings

The [`/investments/holdings/get`](/docs/api/products/investments/#investmentsholdingsget) endpoint allows developers to receive user-authorized stock position data for `investment`-type accounts.

/investments/holdings/get

**Request fields**

[`client_id`](/docs/api/products/investments/#investments-holdings-get-request-client-id)

stringstring

Your Plaid API `client_id`. The `client_id` is required and may be provided either in the `PLAID-CLIENT-ID` header or as part of a request body.

[`secret`](/docs/api/products/investments/#investments-holdings-get-request-secret)

stringstring

Your Plaid API `secret`. The `secret` is required and may be provided either in the `PLAID-SECRET` header or as part of a request body.

[`access_token`](/docs/api/products/investments/#investments-holdings-get-request-access-token)

requiredstringrequired, string

The access token associated with the Item data is being requested for.

[`options`](/docs/api/products/investments/#investments-holdings-get-request-options)

objectobject

An optional object to filter `/investments/holdings/get` results. If provided, must not be `null`.

[`account_ids`](/docs/api/products/investments/#investments-holdings-get-request-options-account-ids)

[string][string]

An array of `account_id`s to retrieve for the Item. An error will be returned if a provided `account_id` is not associated with the Item.

/investments/holdings/get

```
// Pull Holdings for an Item
const request: InvestmentsHoldingsGetRequest = {
  access_token: accessToken,
};
try {
  const response = await plaidClient.investmentsHoldingsGet(request);
  const holdings = response.data.holdings;
  const securities = response.data.securities;
} catch (error) {
  // handle error
}
```

/investments/holdings/get

**Response fields**

[`accounts`](/docs/api/products/investments/#investments-holdings-get-response-accounts)

[object][object]

The accounts associated with the Item

[`account_id`](/docs/api/products/investments/#investments-holdings-get-response-accounts-account-id)

stringstring

Plaid’s unique identifier for the account. This value will not change unless Plaid can't reconcile the account with the data returned by the financial institution. This may occur, for example, when the name of the account changes. If this happens a new `account_id` will be assigned to the account.  
The `account_id` can also change if the `access_token` is deleted and the same credentials that were used to generate that `access_token` are used to generate a new `access_token` on a later date. In that case, the new `account_id` will be different from the old `account_id`.  
If an account with a specific `account_id` disappears instead of changing, the account is likely closed. Closed accounts are not returned by the Plaid API.  
When using a CRA endpoint (an endpoint associated with Plaid Check Consumer Report, i.e. any endpoint beginning with `/cra/`), the `account_id` returned will not match the `account_id` returned by a non-CRA endpoint.  
Like all Plaid identifiers, the `account_id` is case sensitive.

[`balances`](/docs/api/products/investments/#investments-holdings-get-response-accounts-balances)

objectobject

A set of fields describing the balance for an account. Balance information may be cached unless the balance object was returned by `/accounts/balance/get` or `/signal/evaluate` (using a Balance-only ruleset).

[`available`](/docs/api/products/investments/#investments-holdings-get-response-accounts-balances-available)

nullablenumbernullable, number

The amount of funds available to be withdrawn from the account, as determined by the financial institution.  
For `credit`-type accounts, the `available` balance typically equals the `limit` less the `current` balance, less any pending outflows plus any pending inflows.  
For `depository`-type accounts, the `available` balance typically equals the `current` balance less any pending outflows plus any pending inflows. For `depository`-type accounts, the `available` balance does not include the overdraft limit.  
For `investment`-type accounts (or `brokerage`-type accounts for API versions 2018-05-22 and earlier), the `available` balance is the total cash available to withdraw as presented by the institution.  
Note that not all institutions calculate the `available` balance. In the event that `available` balance is unavailable, Plaid will return an `available` balance value of `null`.  
Available balance may be cached and is not guaranteed to be up-to-date in realtime unless the value was returned by `/accounts/balance/get`, or by `/signal/evaluate` with a Balance-only ruleset.  
If `current` is `null` this field is guaranteed not to be `null`.  
  

Format: `double`

[`current`](/docs/api/products/investments/#investments-holdings-get-response-accounts-balances-current)

nullablenumbernullable, number

The total amount of funds in or owed by the account.  
For `credit`-type accounts, a positive balance indicates the amount owed; a negative amount indicates the lender owing the account holder.  
For `loan`-type accounts, the current balance is the principal remaining on the loan, except in the case of student loan accounts at Sallie Mae (`ins_116944`). For Sallie Mae student loans, the account's balance includes both principal and any outstanding interest. Similar to `credit`-type accounts, a positive balance is typically expected, while a negative amount indicates the lender owing the account holder.  
For `investment`-type accounts (or `brokerage`-type accounts for API versions 2018-05-22 and earlier), the current balance is the total value of assets as presented by the institution.  
Note that balance information may be cached unless the value was returned by `/accounts/balance/get` or by `/signal/evaluate` with a Balance-only ruleset; if the Item is enabled for Transactions, the balance will be at least as recent as the most recent Transaction update. If you require realtime balance information, use the `available` balance as provided by `/accounts/balance/get` or `/signal/evaluate` called with a Balance-only `ruleset_key`.  
When returned by `/accounts/balance/get`, this field may be `null`. When this happens, `available` is guaranteed not to be `null`.  
  

Format: `double`

[`limit`](/docs/api/products/investments/#investments-holdings-get-response-accounts-balances-limit)

nullablenumbernullable, number

For `credit`-type accounts, this represents the credit limit.  
For `depository`-type accounts, this represents the pre-arranged overdraft limit, which is common for current (checking) accounts in Europe.  
In North America, this field is typically only available for `credit`-type accounts.  
  

Format: `double`

[`iso_currency_code`](/docs/api/products/investments/#investments-holdings-get-response-accounts-balances-iso-currency-code)

nullablestringnullable, string

The ISO-4217 currency code of the balance. Always null if `unofficial_currency_code` is non-null.

[`unofficial_currency_code`](/docs/api/products/investments/#investments-holdings-get-response-accounts-balances-unofficial-currency-code)

nullablestringnullable, string

The unofficial currency code associated with the balance. Always null if `iso_currency_code` is non-null. Unofficial currency codes are used for currencies that do not have official ISO currency codes, such as cryptocurrencies and the currencies of certain countries.  
See the [currency code schema](https://plaid.com/docs/api/accounts#currency-code-schema) for a full listing of supported `unofficial_currency_code`s.

[`last_updated_datetime`](/docs/api/products/investments/#investments-holdings-get-response-accounts-balances-last-updated-datetime)

nullablestringnullable, string

Timestamp in [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format (`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ`) indicating the last time the balance was updated.  
This field is returned only when the institution is `ins_128026` (Capital One).  
  

Format: `date-time`

[`mask`](/docs/api/products/investments/#investments-holdings-get-response-accounts-mask)

nullablestringnullable, string

Only returned for Auth Items created via Database Auth.  
`database_insights_pass`: The Item's numbers have been verified using Plaid's data sources: the routing and account number match a routing and account number of an account recognized on the Plaid network, and the account is not known by Plaid to be frozen or closed. Only returned for Auth Items created via Database Auth.  
`database_insights_pass_with_caution`: The Item's numbers have been verified using Plaid's data sources and have some signal for being valid: the routing and account number were not recognized on the Plaid network, but the routing number is valid and the account number is a potential valid account number for that routing number. Only returned for Auth Items created via Database Auth.

If defined, will be a value between 0 and 100. Will be undefined if name matching was not enabled for the database verification session or if there were no eligible Plaid network matches to compare the given name with.

A unique and persistent identifier for accounts that can be used to trace multiple instances of the same account across different Items for depository accounts. This field is currently supported only for Items at institutions that use Tokenized Account Numbers (i.e., Chase and PNC, and in May 2025 US Bank). Because these accounts have a different account number each time they are linked, this field may be used instead of the account number to uniquely identify an account across multiple Items for payments use cases, helping to reduce duplicate Items or attempted fraud. In Sandbox, this field is populated for TAN-based institutions (`ins_56`, `ins_13`) as well as the OAuth Sandbox institution (`ins_127287`); in Production, it will only be populated for accounts at applicable institutions.

[`error`](/docs/api/products/investments/#investments-holdings-get-response-item-error)

nullableobjectnullable, object

Errors are identified by `error_code` and categorized by `error_type`. Use these in preference to HTTP status codes to identify and handle specific errors. HTTP status codes are set and provide the broadest categorization of errors: 4xx codes are for developer- or user-related errors, and 5xx codes are for Plaid-related errors, and the status will be 2xx in non-error cases. An Item with a non-`null` error object will only be part of an API response when calling `/item/get` to view Item status. Otherwise, error fields will be `null` if no error has occurred; if an error has occurred, an error code will be returned instead.

#### `/investments/transactions/get`

#### Get investment transactions

The [`/investments/transactions/get`](/docs/api/products/investments/#investmentstransactionsget) endpoint allows developers to retrieve up to 24 months of user-authorized transaction data for investment accounts.

Transactions are returned in reverse-chronological order, and the sequence of transaction ordering is stable and will not shift.

Due to the potentially large number of investment transactions associated with an Item, results are paginated. Manipulate the count and offset parameters in conjunction with the `total_investment_transactions` response body field to fetch all available investment transactions.

Note that Investments does not have a webhook to indicate when initial transaction data has loaded (unless you use the `async_update` option). Instead, if transactions data is not ready when [`/investments/transactions/get`](/docs/api/products/investments/#investmentstransactionsget) is first called, Plaid will wait for the data. For this reason, calling [`/investments/transactions/get`](/docs/api/products/investments/#investmentstransactionsget) immediately after Link may take up to one to two minutes to return.

Data returned by the asynchronous investments extraction flow (when `async_update` is set to true) may not be immediately available to [`/investments/transactions/get`](/docs/api/products/investments/#investmentstransactionsget). To be alerted when the data is ready to be fetched, listen for the `HISTORICAL_UPDATE` webhook. If no investments history is ready when [`/investments/transactions/get`](/docs/api/products/investments/#investmentstransactionsget) is called, it will return a `PRODUCT_NOT_READY` error.

/investments/transactions/get

**Request fields**

[`client_id`](/docs/api/products/investments/#investments-transactions-get-request-client-id)

stringstring

Your Plaid API `client_id`. The `client_id` is required and may be provided either in the `PLAID-CLIENT-ID` header or as part of a request body.

[`secret`](/docs/api/products/investments/#investments-transactions-get-request-secret)

stringstring

Your Plaid API `secret`. The `secret` is required and may be provided either in the `PLAID-SECRET` header or as part of a request body.

[`access_token`](/docs/api/products/investments/#investments-transactions-get-request-access-token)

requiredstringrequired, string

The access token associated with the Item data is being requested for.

[`start_date`](/docs/api/products/investments/#investments-transactions-get-request-start-date)

requiredstringrequired, string

The earliest date for which to fetch transaction history. Dates should be formatted as YYYY-MM-DD.  
  

Format: `date`

[`end_date`](/docs/api/products/investments/#investments-transactions-get-request-end-date)

requiredstringrequired, string

The most recent date for which to fetch transaction history. Dates should be formatted as YYYY-MM-DD.  
  

Format: `date`

[`options`](/docs/api/products/investments/#investments-transactions-get-request-options)

objectobject

An optional object to filter `/investments/transactions/get` results. If provided, must be non-`null`.

[`account_ids`](/docs/api/products/investments/#investments-transactions-get-request-options-account-ids)

[string][string]

An array of `account_ids` to retrieve for the Item.

[`count`](/docs/api/products/investments/#investments-transactions-get-request-options-count)

integerinteger

The number of transactions to fetch.  
  

Default: `100`

Minimum: `1`

Maximum: `500`

[`offset`](/docs/api/products/investments/#investments-transactions-get-request-options-offset)

integerinteger

The number of transactions to skip when fetching transaction history  
  

Default: `0`

Minimum: `0`

[`async_update`](/docs/api/products/investments/#investments-transactions-get-request-options-async-update)

booleanboolean

If the Item was not initialized with the investments product via the `products`, `required_if_supported_products`, or `optional_products` array when calling `/link/token/create`, and `async_update` is set to true, the initial Investments extraction will happen asynchronously. Plaid will subsequently fire a `HISTORICAL_UPDATE` webhook when the extraction completes. When `false`, Plaid will wait to return a response until extraction completion and no `HISTORICAL_UPDATE` webhook will fire. Note that while the extraction is happening asynchronously, calls to `/investments/transactions/get` and `/investments/refresh` will return `PRODUCT_NOT_READY` errors until the extraction completes.  
  

Default: `false`

/investments/transactions/get

```
const request: InvestmentsTransactionsGetRequest = {
  access_token: accessToken,
  start_date: '2019-01-01',
  end_date: '2019-06-10',
};

For info about the various flows, see our [Auth coverage documentation](https://plaid.com/docs/auth/coverage/).  
`INSTANT_AUTH`: The Item's Auth data was provided directly by the user's institution connection.  
`INSTANT_MATCH`: The Item's Auth data was provided via the Instant Match fallback flow.  
`AUTOMATED_MICRODEPOSITS`: The Item's Auth data was provided via the Automated Micro-deposits flow.  
`SAME_DAY_MICRODEPOSITS`: The Item's Auth data was provided via the Same Day Micro-deposits flow.  
`INSTANT_MICRODEPOSITS`: The Item's Auth data was provided via the Instant Micro-deposits flow.  
`DATABASE_MATCH`: The Item's Auth data was provided via the Database Match flow.

`TRANSFER_MIGRATED`: The Item's Auth data was provided via [`/transfer/migrate_account`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transfer/account-linking/#migrate-account-into-transfers).  
`INVESTMENTS_FALLBACK`: The Item's Auth data for Investments Move was provided via a [fallback flow](https://plaid.com/docs/investments-move/#fallback-flows).  
  

Possible values: `INSTANT_AUTH`, `INSTANT_MATCH`, `AUTOMATED_MICRODEPOSITS`, `SAME_DAY_MICRODEPOSITS`, `INSTANT_MICRODEPOSITS`, `DATABASE_MATCH`, `DATABASE_INSIGHTS`, `TRANSFER_MIGRATED`, `INVESTMENTS_FALLBACK`, `null`

[`error`](/docs/api/products/investments/#investments-transactions-get-response-item-error)

nullableobjectnullable, object

Errors are identified by `error_code` and categorized by `error_type`. Use these in preference to HTTP status codes to identify and handle specific errors. HTTP status codes are set and provide the broadest categorization of errors: 4xx codes are for developer- or user-related errors, and 5xx codes are for Plaid-related errors, and the status will be 2xx in non-error cases. An Item with a non-`null` error object will only be part of an API response when calling `/item/get` to view Item status. Otherwise, error fields will be `null` if no error has occurred; if an error has occurred, an error code will be returned instead.

[`error_type`](/docs/api/products/investments/#investments-transactions-get-response-item-error-error-type)

[`billed_products`](/docs/api/products/investments/#investments-transactions-get-response-item-billed-products)

[string][string]

A list of products that have been billed for the Item. The contents of this array will be mutually exclusive with `available_products`. Note - `billed_products` is populated in all environments but only requests in Production are billed.

For some products, it is possible for the product to be added to an Item but not yet billed (e.g. Assets, before `/asset_report/create` has been called, or Auth or Identity when added as Optional Products but before their endpoints have been called), in which case the product may appear in `products` but not in `billed_products`.  
  

Possible values: `assets`, `auth`, `balance`, `balance_plus`, `beacon`, `identity`, `identity_match`, `investments`, `investments_auth`, `liabilities`, `payment_initiation`, `identity_verification`, `transactions`, `credit_details`, `income`, `income_verification`, `standing_orders`, `transfer`, `employment`, `recurring_transactions`, `transactions_refresh`, `signal`, `statements`, `processor_payments`, `processor_identity`, `profile`, `cra_base_report`, `cra_income_insights`, `cra_partner_insights`, `cra_network_insights`, `cra_cashflow_insights`, `cra_monitoring`, `cra_lend_score`, `cra_plaid_credit_score`, `layer`, `pay_by_bank`, `protect_linked_bank`

[`consented_products`](/docs/api/products/investments/#investments-transactions-get-response-item-consented-products)

[string][string]

A list of products that the user has consented to for the Item via [Data Transparency Messaging](https://plaid.com/docs/link/data-transparency-messaging-migration-guide). This will consist of all products where both of the following are true: the user has consented to the required data scopes for that product and you have Production access for that product.  
  

Possible values: `assets`, `auth`, `balance`, `balance_plus`, `beacon`, `identity`, `identity_match`, `investments`, `investments_auth`, `liabilities`, `transactions`, `income`, `income_verification`, `transfer`, `employment`, `recurring_transactions`, `signal`, `statements`, `processor_payments`, `processor_identity`, `cra_base_report`, `cra_income_insights`, `cra_lend_score`, `cra_partner_insights`, `cra_cashflow_insights`, `cra_monitoring`, `layer`

[`consent_expiration_time`](/docs/api/products/investments/#investments-transactions-get-response-item-consent-expiration-time)

nullablestringnullable, string

The date and time at which the Item's access consent will expire, in [ISO 8601](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format. If the Item does not have consent expiration scheduled, this field will be `null`. Currently, only institutions in Europe and a small number of institutions in the US have expiring consent. For a list of US institutions that currently expire consent, see the [OAuth Guide](https://plaid.com/docs/link/oauth/#refreshing-item-consent).  
  

Format: `date-time`

[`update_type`](/docs/api/products/investments/#investments-transactions-get-response-item-update-type)

stringstring

Indicates whether an Item requires user interaction to be updated, which can be the case for Items with some forms of two-factor authentication.  
`background` - Item can be updated in the background  
`user_present_required` - Item requires user interaction to be updated  
  

Possible values: `background`, `user_present_required`

[`accounts`](/docs/api/products/investments/#investments-transactions-get-response-accounts)

[object][object]

The accounts for which transaction history is being fetched.

[`account_id`](/docs/api/products/investments/#investments-transactions-get-response-accounts-account-id)

stringstring

Plaid’s unique identifier for the account. This value will not change unless Plaid can't reconcile the account with the data returned by the financial institution. This may occur, for example, when the name of the account changes. If this happens a new `account_id` will be assigned to the account.  
The `account_id` can also change if the `access_token` is deleted and the same credentials that were used to generate that `access_token` are used to generate a new `access_token` on a later date. In that case, the new `account_id` will be different from the old `account_id`.  
If an account with a specific `account_id` disappears instead of changing, the account is likely closed. Closed accounts are not returned by the Plaid API.  
When using a CRA endpoint (an endpoint associated with Plaid Check Consumer Report, i.e. any endpoint beginning with `/cra/`), the `account_id` returned will not match the `account_id` returned by a non-CRA endpoint.  
Like all Plaid identifiers, the `account_id` is case sensitive.

[`balances`](/docs/api/products/investments/#investments-transactions-get-response-accounts-balances)

objectobject

A set of fields describing the balance for an account. Balance information may be cached unless the balance object was returned by `/accounts/balance/get` or `/signal/evaluate` (using a Balance-only ruleset).

[`available`](/docs/api/products/investments/#investments-transactions-get-response-accounts-balances-available)

nullablenumbernullable, number

The amount of funds available to be withdrawn from the account, as determined by the financial institution.  
For `credit`-type accounts, the `available` balance typically equals the `limit` less the `current` balance, less any pending outflows plus any pending inflows.  
For `depository`-type accounts, the `available` balance typically equals the `current` balance less any pending outflows plus any pending inflows. For `depository`-type accounts, the `available` balance does not include the overdraft limit.  
For `investment`-type accounts (or `brokerage`-type accounts for API versions 2018-05-22 and earlier), the `available` balance is the total cash available to withdraw as presented by the institution.  
Note that not all institutions calculate the `available` balance. In the event that `available` balance is unavailable, Plaid will return an `available` balance value of `null`.  
Available balance may be cached and is not guaranteed to be up-to-date in realtime unless the value was returned by `/accounts/balance/get`, or by `/signal/evaluate` with a Balance-only ruleset.  
If `current` is `null` this field is guaranteed not to be `null`.  
  

Format: `double`

[`current`](/docs/api/products/investments/#investments-transactions-get-response-accounts-balances-current)

nullablenumbernullable, number

The total amount of funds in or owed by the account.  
For `credit`-type accounts, a positive balance indicates the amount owed; a negative amount indicates the lender owing the account holder.  
For `loan`-type accounts, the current balance is the principal remaining on the loan, except in the case of student loan accounts at Sallie Mae (`ins_116944`). For Sallie Mae student loans, the account's balance includes both principal and any outstanding interest. Similar to `credit`-type accounts, a positive balance is typically expected, while a negative amount indicates the lender owing the account holder.  
For `investment`-type accounts (or `brokerage`-type accounts for API versions 2018-05-22 and earlier), the current balance is the total value of assets as presented by the institution.  
Note that balance information may be cached unless the value was returned by `/accounts/balance/get` or by `/signal/evaluate` with a Balance-only ruleset; if the Item is enabled for Transactions, the balance will be at least as recent as the most recent Transaction update. If you require realtime balance information, use the `available` balance as provided by `/accounts/balance/get` or `/signal/evaluate` called with a Balance-only `ruleset_key`.  
When returned by `/accounts/balance/get`, this field may be `null`. When this happens, `available` is guaranteed not to be `null`.  
  

Format: `double`

[`limit`](/docs/api/products/investments/#investments-transactions-get-response-accounts-balances-limit)

nullablenumbernullable, number

For `credit`-type accounts, this represents the credit limit.  
For `depository`-type accounts, this represents the pre-arranged overdraft limit, which is common for current (checking) accounts in Europe.  
In North America, this field is typically only available for `credit`-type accounts.  
  

Format: `double`

[`iso_currency_code`](/docs/api/products/investments/#investments-transactions-get-response-accounts-balances-iso-currency-code)

nullablestringnullable, string

Only returned for Auth Items created via Database Auth.  
`database_insights_pass`: The Item's numbers have been verified using Plaid's data sources: the routing and account number match a routing and account number of an account recognized on the Plaid network, and the account is not known by Plaid to be frozen or closed. Only returned for Auth Items created via Database Auth.  
`database_insights_pass_with_caution`: The Item's numbers have been verified using Plaid's data sources and have some signal for being valid: the routing and account number were not recognized on the Plaid network, but the routing number is valid and the account number is a potential valid account number for that routing number.

#### `/investments/refresh`

#### Refresh investment data

[`/investments/refresh`](/docs/api/products/investments/#investmentsrefresh) is an optional endpoint for users of the Investments product. It initiates an on-demand extraction to fetch the newest investment holdings and transactions for an Item. This on-demand extraction takes place in addition to the periodic extractions that automatically occur one or more times per day for any Investments-enabled Item. If changes to investments are discovered after calling [`/investments/refresh`](/docs/api/products/investments/#investmentsrefresh), Plaid will fire webhooks: [`HOLDINGS: DEFAULT_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/investments/#holdings-default_update) if any new holdings are detected, and [`INVESTMENTS_TRANSACTIONS: DEFAULT_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/investments/#investments_transactions-default_update) if any new investment transactions are detected. This webhook will typically not fire in the Sandbox environment, due to the lack of dynamic investment transactions and holdings data. To test this webhook in Sandbox, call [`/sandbox/item/fire_webhook`](/docs/api/sandbox/#sandboxitemfire_webhook). Updated holdings and investment transactions can be fetched by calling [`/investments/holdings/get`](/docs/api/products/investments/#investmentsholdingsget) and [`/investments/transactions/get`](/docs/api/products/investments/#investmentstransactionsget). Note that the [`/investments/refresh`](/docs/api/products/investments/#investmentsrefresh) endpoint is not supported by all institutions. If called on an Item from an institution that does not support this functionality, it will return a `PRODUCT_NOT_SUPPORTED` error.

As this endpoint triggers a synchronous request for fresh data, latency may be higher than for other Plaid endpoints (typically less than 10 seconds, but occasionally up to 30 seconds or more); if you encounter errors, you may find it necessary to adjust your timeout period when making requests.

[`/investments/refresh`](/docs/api/products/investments/#investmentsrefresh) is offered as an add-on to Investments and has a separate [fee model](https://plaid.com/docs/account/billing/#per-request-flat-fee). To request access to this endpoint, submit a [product access request](https://dashboard.plaid.com/team/products) or contact your Plaid account manager.

### Webhooks

Updates are sent to indicate that new holdings or investment transactions are available.

=\*=\*=\*=

#### `HOLDINGS: DEFAULT_UPDATE`

Fired when new or updated holdings have been detected on an investment account. The webhook typically fires in response to any newly added holdings or price changes to existing holdings, most commonly after market close.

**Properties**

[`webhook_type`](/docs/api/products/investments/#HoldingsDefaultUpdateWebhook-webhook-type)

stringstring

`HOLDINGS`

[`webhook_code`](/docs/api/products/investments/#HoldingsDefaultUpdateWebhook-webhook-code)

[`error`](/docs/api/products/investments/#HoldingsDefaultUpdateWebhook-error)

objectobject

Errors are identified by `error_code` and categorized by `error_type`. Use these in preference to HTTP status codes to identify and handle specific errors. HTTP status codes are set and provide the broadest categorization of errors: 4xx codes are for developer- or user-related errors, and 5xx codes are for Plaid-related errors, and the status will be 2xx in non-error cases. An Item with a non-`null` error object will only be part of an API response when calling `/item/get` to view Item status. Otherwise, error fields will be `null` if no error has occurred; if an error has occurred, an error code will be returned instead.

[`error_type`](/docs/api/products/investments/#HoldingsDefaultUpdateWebhook-error-error-type)

stringstring

A broad categorization of the error. Safe for programmatic use.  
  

Possible values: `INVALID_REQUEST`, `INVALID_RESULT`, `INVALID_INPUT`, `INSTITUTION_ERROR`, `RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED`, `API_ERROR`, `ITEM_ERROR`, `ASSET_REPORT_ERROR`, `RECAPTCHA_ERROR`, `OAUTH_ERROR`, `PAYMENT_ERROR`, `BANK_TRANSFER_ERROR`, `INCOME_VERIFICATION_ERROR`, `MICRODEPOSITS_ERROR`, `SANDBOX_ERROR`, `PARTNER_ERROR`, `SIGNAL_ERROR`, `TRANSACTIONS_ERROR`, `TRANSACTION_ERROR`, `TRANSFER_ERROR`, `CHECK_REPORT_ERROR`, `CONSUMER_REPORT_ERROR`, `USER_ERROR`

stringstring

The particular error code. Safe for programmatic use.

[`error_code_reason`](/docs/api/products/investments/#HoldingsDefaultUpdateWebhook-error-error-code-reason)

stringstring

The specific reason for the error code. Currently, reasons are only supported OAuth-based item errors; `null` will be returned otherwise. Safe for programmatic use.  
Possible values:
`OAUTH_INVALID_TOKEN`: The user’s OAuth connection to this institution has been invalidated.  
`OAUTH_CONSENT_EXPIRED`: The user's access consent for this OAuth connection to this institution has expired.  
`OAUTH_USER_REVOKED`: The user’s OAuth connection to this institution is invalid because the user revoked their connection.

[`error_message`](/docs/api/products/investments/#HoldingsDefaultUpdateWebhook-error-error-message)

stringstring

A developer-friendly representation of the error code. This may change over time and is not safe for programmatic use.

[`display_message`](/docs/api/products/investments/#HoldingsDefaultUpdateWebhook-error-display-message)

stringstring

A user-friendly representation of the error code. `null` if the error is not related to user action.  
This may change over time and is not safe for programmatic use.

[`request_id`](/docs/api/products/investments/#HoldingsDefaultUpdateWebhook-error-request-id)

`causes` will be provided for the `error_type` `ASSET_REPORT_ERROR` or `CHECK_REPORT_ERROR`. `causes` will also not be populated inside an error nested within a `warning` object.

[`status`](/docs/api/products/investments/#HoldingsDefaultUpdateWebhook-error-status)

integerinteger

The HTTP status code associated with the error. This will only be returned in the response body when the error information is provided via a webhook.

[`documentation_url`](/docs/api/products/investments/#HoldingsDefaultUpdateWebhook-error-documentation-url)

stringstring

The URL of a Plaid documentation page with more information about the error

[`suggested_action`](/docs/api/products/investments/#HoldingsDefaultUpdateWebhook-error-suggested-action)

[`error`](/docs/api/products/investments/#InvestmentsDefaultUpdateWebhook-error)

objectobject

Errors are identified by `error_code` and categorized by `error_type`. Use these in preference to HTTP status codes to identify and handle specific errors. HTTP status codes are set and provide the broadest categorization of errors: 4xx codes are for developer- or user-related errors, and 5xx codes are for Plaid-related errors, and the status will be 2xx in non-error cases. An Item with a non-`null` error object will only be part of an API response when calling `/item/get` to view Item status. Otherwise, error fields will be `null` if no error has occurred; if an error has occurred, an error code will be returned instead.
