#### `/signal/evaluate`

#### Evaluate a planned ACH transaction

Use [`/signal/evaluate`](/docs/api/products/signal/#signalevaluate) to evaluate a planned ACH transaction to get a return risk assessment and additional risk signals.

Before using [`/signal/evaluate`](/docs/api/products/signal/#signalevaluate), you must first [create a ruleset](https://plaid.com/docs/signal/signal-rules/) in the Dashboard under [**Signal->Rules**](https://dashboard.plaid.com/signal/risk-profiles).

[`/signal/evaluate`](/docs/api/products/signal/#signalevaluate) can be used with either Signal Transaction Scores or the Balance product. Which product is used will be determined by the `ruleset_key` that you provide. For more details, see [Signal Rules](https://plaid.com/docs/signal/signal-rules/).

Note: This request may have higher latency when using a Balance-only ruleset. This is because Plaid must communicate directly with the institution to request data. Balance-only rulesets may have latency of up to 30 seconds or more; if you encounter errors, you may find it necessary to adjust your timeout period when making requests.

/signal/evaluate

**Request fields**

[`client_id`](/docs/api/products/signal/#signal-evaluate-request-client-id)

stringstring

Your Plaid API `client_id`. The `client_id` is required and may be provided either in the `PLAID-CLIENT-ID` header or as part of a request body.

[`secret`](/docs/api/products/signal/#signal-evaluate-request-secret)

stringstring

Your Plaid API `secret`. The `secret` is required and may be provided either in the `PLAID-SECRET` header or as part of a request body.

[`account_id`](/docs/api/products/signal/#signal-evaluate-request-account-id)

requiredstringrequired, string

The Plaid `account_id` of the account that is the funding source for the proposed transaction. The `account_id` is returned in the `/accounts/get` endpoint as well as the [`onSuccess`](https://plaid.com/docs/link/ios/#link-ios-onsuccess-linkSuccess-metadata-accounts-id) callback metadata.  
This will return an [`INVALID_ACCOUNT_ID`](https://plaid.com/docs/errors/invalid-input/#invalid_account_id) error if the account has been removed at the bank or if the `account_id` is no longer valid.

[`client_transaction_id`](/docs/api/products/signal/#signal-evaluate-request-client-transaction-id)

requiredstringrequired, string

The unique ID that you would like to use to refer to this evaluation attempt - for example, a payment attempt ID. You will use this later to debug this evaluation, and/or report an ACH return, etc. The max length for this field is 36 characters.  
  

Min length: `1`

Max length: `36`

stringstring

A unique ID that identifies the end user in your system. This ID is used to correlate requests by a user with multiple Items. Personally identifiable information, such as an email address or phone number, should not be used in the `client_user_id`.

[`is_recurring`](/docs/api/products/signal/#signal-evaluate-request-is-recurring)

booleanboolean

Use `true` if the ACH transaction is a part of recurring schedule (for example, a monthly repayment); `false` otherwise. When using a Balance-only ruleset, this field is ignored.

[`default_payment_method`](/docs/api/products/signal/#signal-evaluate-request-default-payment-method)

stringstring

The default ACH payment method to complete the transaction. When using a Balance-only ruleset, this field is ignored.
`SAME_DAY_ACH`: Same Day ACH by Nacha. The debit transaction is processed and settled on the same day.

The object contains a risk score and a risk tier that evaluate the transaction return risk of an unauthorized debit. Common return codes in this category include: "R05", "R07", "R10", "R11", "R29". These returns typically have a return time frame of up to 60 calendar days. During this period, the customer of financial institutions can dispute a transaction as unauthorized.

[`score`](/docs/api/products/signal/#signal-evaluate-response-scores-customer-initiated-return-risk-score)

integerinteger

A score from 1-99 that indicates the transaction return risk: a higher risk score suggests a higher return likelihood.  
  

Minimum: `1`

Maximum: `99`

[`bank_initiated_return_risk`](/docs/api/products/signal/#signal-evaluate-response-scores-bank-initiated-return-risk)

objectobject

[`core_attributes`](/docs/api/products/signal/#signal-evaluate-response-core-attributes)

objectobject

The core attributes object contains additional data that can be used to assess the ACH return risk.   
If using a Balance-only ruleset, only `available_balance` and `current_balance` will be returned as core attributes. If using a Signal Transaction Scores ruleset, over 80 core attributes will be returned. Examples of attributes include:  
`available_balance` and `current_balance`: The balance in the ACH transaction funding account
`days_since_first_plaid_connection`: The number of days since the first time the Item was connected to an application via Plaid
`plaid_connections_count_7d`: The number of times the Item has been connected to applications via Plaid over the past 7 days
`plaid_connections_count_30d`: The number of times the Item has been connected to applications via Plaid over the past 30 days
`total_plaid_connections_count`: The number of times the Item has been connected to applications via Plaid
`is_savings_or_money_market_account`: Indicates whether the ACH transaction funding account is a savings/money market account

stringstring

The result of the rule that was triggered for this transaction.  
`ACCEPT`: Accept the transaction for processing.
`REROUTE`: Reroute the transaction to a different payment method, as this transaction is too risky.
`REVIEW`: Review the transaction before proceeding.  
  

Possible values: `ACCEPT`, `REROUTE`, `REVIEW`

[`triggered_rule_details`](/docs/api/products/signal/#signal-evaluate-response-ruleset-triggered-rule-details)

nullableobjectnullable, object

Rules are run in numerical order. The first rule with a logic match is triggered. These are the details of that rule.

[`internal_note`](/docs/api/products/signal/#signal-evaluate-response-ruleset-triggered-rule-details-internal-note)

stringstring

An optional message attached to the triggered rule, defined within the Dashboard, for your internal use. Useful for debugging, such as “Account appears to be closed.”

#### `/signal/decision/report`

#### Report whether you initiated an ACH transaction

After you call [`/signal/evaluate`](/docs/api/products/signal/#signalevaluate), Plaid will normally infer the outcome from your Signal Rules. However, if you are not using Signal Rules, if the Signal Rules outcome was `REVIEW`, or if you take a different action than the one determined by the Signal Rules, you will need to call [`/signal/decision/report`](/docs/api/products/signal/#signaldecisionreport). This helps improve Signal Transaction Score accuracy for your account and is necessary for proper functioning of the rule performance and rule tuning capabilities in the Dashboard. If your effective decision changes after calling [`/signal/decision/report`](/docs/api/products/signal/#signaldecisionreport) (for example, you indicated that you accepted a transaction, but later on, your payment processor rejected it, so it was never initiated), call [`/signal/decision/report`](/docs/api/products/signal/#signaldecisionreport) again for the transaction to correct Plaid's records.

If you are using Plaid Transfer as your payment processor, you also do not need to call [`/signal/decision/report`](/docs/api/products/signal/#signaldecisionreport), as Plaid can infer outcomes from your Transfer activity.

If using a Balance-only ruleset, this endpoint will not impact scores (Balance does not use scores), but is necessary to view accurate transaction outcomes and tune rule logic in the Dashboard.

You should also use this field if you decide to accelerate the fund availability for your customers.  
`REVIEW`: the transaction requires manual review  
`REJECT`: reject the transaction  
`TAKE_OTHER_RISK_MEASURES`: for example, placing a longer hold on funds than those approved transactions or introducing customer frictions such as step-up verification/authentication  
`NOT_EVALUATED`: if only logging the results without using them

#### `/signal/prepare`

#### Opt-in an Item to Signal Transaction Scores

When an Item is not initialized with `signal`, call [`/signal/prepare`](/docs/api/products/signal/#signalprepare) to opt-in that Item to the data collection process used to develop a Signal Transaction Score. This should be done on Items where `signal` was added in the `additional_consented_products` array but not in the `products`, `optional_products`, or `required_if_supported_products` array. If [`/signal/prepare`](/docs/api/products/signal/#signalprepare) is skipped on an Item that is not initialized with `signal`, the initial call to [`/signal/evaluate`](/docs/api/products/signal/#signalevaluate) on that Item will be less accurate, because Plaid will have access to less data for computing the Signal Transaction Score.

If your integration is purely Balance-only, this endpoint will have no effect, as Balance-only rulesets do not calculate a Signal Transaction Score.

If run on an Item that is already initialized with `signal`, this endpoint will return a 200 response and will not modify the Item.

/signal/prepare

**Request fields**

#### `/accounts/balance/get`

#### Retrieve real-time balance data

The [`/accounts/balance/get`](/docs/api/products/signal/#accountsbalanceget) endpoint returns the real-time balance for each of an Item's accounts. While other endpoints, such as [`/accounts/get`](/docs/api/accounts/#accountsget), return a balance object, [`/accounts/balance/get`](/docs/api/products/signal/#accountsbalanceget) forces the available and current balance fields to be refreshed rather than cached. This endpoint can be used for existing Items that were added via any of Plaid’s other products. This endpoint can be used as long as Link has been initialized with any other product, `balance` itself is not a product that can be used to initialize Link. As this endpoint triggers a synchronous request for fresh data, latency may be higher than for other Plaid endpoints (typically less than 10 seconds, but occasionally up to 30 seconds or more); if you encounter errors, you may find it necessary to adjust your timeout period when making requests.

Note: If you are getting real-time balance for the purpose of assessing the return risk of a proposed ACH transaction, it is recommended to use [`/signal/evaluate`](/docs/api/products/signal/#signalevaluate) instead of [`/accounts/balance/get`](/docs/api/products/signal/#accountsbalanceget). [`/signal/evaluate`](/docs/api/products/signal/#signalevaluate) returns the same real-time balance information and also provides access to Signal Rules, which provides no-code transaction business logic configuration, backtesting and recommendations for tuning your transaction acceptance logic, and the ability to easily switch between Balance and Signal Transaction Scores as needed for ultra-low-latency, ML-powered risk assessments. For more details, see the [Balance documentation](/docs/balance/#balance-integration-options).

/accounts/balance/get

**Request fields**

[`access_token`](/docs/api/products/signal/#accounts-balance-get-request-access-token)

requiredstringrequired, string

The access token associated with the Item data is being requested for.

[`secret`](/docs/api/products/signal/#accounts-balance-get-request-secret)

stringstring

Your Plaid API `secret`. The `secret` is required and may be provided either in the `PLAID-SECRET` header or as part of a request body.

[`client_id`](/docs/api/products/signal/#accounts-balance-get-request-client-id)

stringstring

Your Plaid API `client_id`. The `client_id` is required and may be provided either in the `PLAID-CLIENT-ID` header or as part of a request body.

[`options`](/docs/api/products/signal/#accounts-balance-get-request-options)

objectobject

Optional parameters to `/accounts/balance/get`.

[`account_ids`](/docs/api/products/signal/#accounts-balance-get-request-options-account-ids)

[string][string]

A list of `account_ids` to retrieve for the Item. The default value is `null`.  
Note: An error will be returned if a provided `account_id` is not associated with the Item.

[`min_last_updated_datetime`](/docs/api/products/signal/#accounts-balance-get-request-options-min-last-updated-datetime)

stringstring

Timestamp in [ISO 8601](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format (`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ`) indicating the oldest acceptable balance when making a request to `/accounts/balance/get`.  
This field is only necessary when the institution is `ins_128026` (Capital One), *and* one or more account types being requested is a non-depository account (such as a credit card) as Capital One does not provide real-time balance for non-depository accounts. In this case, a value must be provided or an `INVALID_REQUEST` error with the code of `INVALID_FIELD` will be returned. For all other institutions, as well as for depository accounts at Capital One (including all checking and savings accounts) this field is ignored and real-time balance information will be fetched.  
If this field is not ignored, and no acceptable balance is available, an `INVALID_RESULT` error with the code `LAST_UPDATED_DATETIME_OUT_OF_RANGE` will be returned.  
  

Format: `date-time`

/accounts/balance/get

```
// Pull real-time balance information for each account associated
// with the Item
const request: AccountsGetRequest = {
  access_token: accessToken,
};
try {
  const response = await plaidClient.accountsBalanceGet(request);
  const accounts = response.data.accounts;
} catch (error) {
  // handle error
}
```

/accounts/balance/get

**Response fields**

[`accounts`](/docs/api/products/signal/#accounts-balance-get-response-accounts)

[object][object]

An array of financial institution accounts associated with the Item.
If `/accounts/balance/get` was called, each account will include real-time balance information.

[`account_id`](/docs/api/products/signal/#accounts-balance-get-response-accounts-account-id)

stringstring

Plaid’s unique identifier for the account. This value will not change unless Plaid can't reconcile the account with the data returned by the financial institution. This may occur, for example, when the name of the account changes. If this happens a new `account_id` will be assigned to the account.  
The `account_id` can also change if the `access_token` is deleted and the same credentials that were used to generate that `access_token` are used to generate a new `access_token` on a later date. In that case, the new `account_id` will be different from the old `account_id`.  
If an account with a specific `account_id` disappears instead of changing, the account is likely closed. Closed accounts are not returned by the Plaid API.  
When using a CRA endpoint (an endpoint associated with Plaid Check Consumer Report, i.e. any endpoint beginning with `/cra/`), the `account_id` returned will not match the `account_id` returned by a non-CRA endpoint.  
Like all Plaid identifiers, the `account_id` is case sensitive.

[`balances`](/docs/api/products/signal/#accounts-balance-get-response-accounts-balances)

objectobject

A set of fields describing the balance for an account. Balance information may be cached unless the balance object was returned by `/accounts/balance/get` or `/signal/evaluate` (using a Balance-only ruleset).

[`available`](/docs/api/products/signal/#accounts-balance-get-response-accounts-balances-available)

nullablenumbernullable, number

The amount of funds available to be withdrawn from the account, as determined by the financial institution.  
For `credit`-type accounts, the `available` balance typically equals the `limit` less the `current` balance, less any pending outflows plus any pending inflows.  
For `depository`-type accounts, the `available` balance typically equals the `current` balance less any pending outflows plus any pending inflows. For `depository`-type accounts, the `available` balance does not include the overdraft limit.  
For `investment`-type accounts (or `brokerage`-type accounts for API versions 2018-05-22 and earlier), the `available` balance is the total cash available to withdraw as presented by the institution.  
Note that not all institutions calculate the `available` balance. In the event that `available` balance is unavailable, Plaid will return an `available` balance value of `null`.  
Available balance may be cached and is not guaranteed to be up-to-date in realtime unless the value was returned by `/accounts/balance/get`, or by `/signal/evaluate` with a Balance-only ruleset.  
If `current` is `null` this field is guaranteed not to be `null`.  
  

Format: `double`

[`current`](/docs/api/products/signal/#accounts-balance-get-response-accounts-balances-current)

nullablenumbernullable, number

The total amount of funds in or owed by the account.  
For `credit`-type accounts, a positive balance indicates the amount owed; a negative amount indicates the lender owing the account holder.  
For `loan`-type accounts, the current balance is the principal remaining on the loan, except in the case of student loan accounts at Sallie Mae (`ins_116944`). For Sallie Mae student loans, the account's balance includes both principal and any outstanding interest. Similar to `credit`-type accounts, a positive balance is typically expected, while a negative amount indicates the lender owing the account holder.  
For `investment`-type accounts (or `brokerage`-type accounts for API versions 2018-05-22 and earlier), the current balance is the total value of assets as presented by the institution.  
Note that balance information may be cached unless the value was returned by `/accounts/balance/get` or by `/signal/evaluate` with a Balance-only ruleset; if the Item is enabled for Transactions, the balance will be at least as recent as the most recent Transaction update. If you require realtime balance information, use the `available` balance as provided by `/accounts/balance/get` or `/signal/evaluate` called with a Balance-only `ruleset_key`.  
When returned by `/accounts/balance/get`, this field may be `null`. When this happens, `available` is guaranteed not to be `null`.  
  

Format: `double`

[`limit`](/docs/api/products/signal/#accounts-balance-get-response-accounts-balances-limit)

nullablenumbernullable, number

For `credit`-type accounts, this represents the credit limit.  
For `depository`-type accounts, this represents the pre-arranged overdraft limit, which is common for current (checking) accounts in Europe.  
In North America, this field is typically only available for `credit`-type accounts.  
  

Format: `double`

[`iso_currency_code`](/docs/api/products/signal/#accounts-balance-get-response-accounts-balances-iso-currency-code)

nullablestringnullable, string

The ISO-4217 currency code of the balance. Always null if `unofficial_currency_code` is non-null.

[`unofficial_currency_code`](/docs/api/products/signal/#accounts-balance-get-response-accounts-balances-unofficial-currency-code)

nullablestringnullable, string

The unofficial currency code associated with the balance. Always null if `iso_currency_code` is non-null. Unofficial currency codes are used for currencies that do not have official ISO currency codes, such as cryptocurrencies and the currencies of certain countries.  
See the [currency code schema](https://plaid.com/docs/api/accounts#currency-code-schema) for a full listing of supported `unofficial_currency_code`s.

[`last_updated_datetime`](/docs/api/products/signal/#accounts-balance-get-response-accounts-balances-last-updated-datetime)

This field is returned only when the institution is `ins_128026` (Capital One).  
  

Format: `date-time`

[`mask`](/docs/api/products/signal/#accounts-balance-get-response-accounts-mask)

`pending_manual_verification`: The Item is pending manual micro-deposit verification. Items remain in this state until the user successfully verifies the code.  
`automatically_verified`: The Item has successfully been automatically verified.  
`manually_verified`: The Item has successfully been manually verified.  
`verification_expired`: Plaid was unable to automatically verify the deposit within 7 calendar days and will no longer attempt to validate the Item. Users may retry by submitting their information again through Link.  
`verification_failed`: The Item failed manual micro-deposit verification because the user exhausted all 3 verification attempts. Users may retry by submitting their information again through Link.  
`unsent`: The Item is pending micro-deposit verification, but Plaid has not yet sent the micro-deposit.  
`database_insights_pending`: The Database Auth result is pending and will be available upon Auth request.  
`database_insights_fail`: The Item's numbers have been verified using Plaid's data sources and have signal for being invalid and/or have no signal for being valid. Typically this indicates that the routing number is invalid, the account number does not match the account number format associated with the routing number, or the account has been reported as closed or frozen. Only returned for Auth Items created via Database Auth.  
`database_insights_pass`: The Item's numbers have been verified using Plaid's data sources: the routing and account number match a routing and account number of an account recognized on the Plaid network, and the account is not known by Plaid to be frozen or closed. Only returned for Auth Items created via Database Auth.  
`database_insights_pass_with_caution`: The Item's numbers have been verified using Plaid's data sources and have some signal for being valid: the routing and account number were not recognized on the Plaid network, but the routing number is valid and the account number is a potential valid account number for that routing number. Only returned for Auth Items created via Database Auth.  
`database_matched`: (deprecated) The Item has successfully been verified using Plaid's data sources. Only returned for Auth Items created via Database Match.  
`null` or empty string: Neither micro-deposit-based verification nor database verification are being used for the Item.

A unique and persistent identifier for accounts that can be used to trace multiple instances of the same account across different Items for depository accounts. This field is currently supported only for Items at institutions that use Tokenized Account Numbers (i.e., Chase and PNC, and in May 2025 US Bank). Because these accounts have a different account number each time they are linked, this field may be used instead of the account number to uniquely identify an account across multiple Items for payments use cases, helping to reduce duplicate Items or attempted fraud. In Sandbox, this field is populated for TAN-based institutions (`ins_56`, `ins_13`) as well as the OAuth Sandbox institution (`ins_127287`); in Production, it will only be populated for accounts at applicable institutions.

[`error`](/docs/api/products/signal/#accounts-balance-get-response-item-error)

nullableobjectnullable, object

Errors are identified by `error_code` and categorized by `error_type`. Use these in preference to HTTP status codes to identify and handle specific errors. HTTP status codes are set and provide the broadest categorization of errors: 4xx codes are for developer- or user-related errors, and 5xx codes are for Plaid-related errors, and the status will be 2xx in non-error cases. An Item with a non-`null` error object will only be part of an API response when calling `/item/get` to view Item status. Otherwise, error fields will be `null` if no error has occurred; if an error has occurred, an error code will be returned instead.

Possible values: `assets`, `auth`, `balance`, `balance_plus`, `beacon`, `identity`, `identity_match`, `investments`, `investments_auth`, `liabilities`, `payment_initiation`, `identity_verification`, `transactions`, `credit_details`, `income`, `income_verification`, `standing_orders`, `transfer`, `employment`, `recurring_transactions`, `transactions_refresh`, `signal`, `statements`, `processor_payments`, `processor_identity`, `profile`, `cra_base_report`, `cra_income_insights`, `cra_partner_insights`, `cra_network_insights`, `cra_cashflow_insights`, `cra_monitoring`, `cra_lend_score`, `cra_plaid_credit_score`, `layer`, `pay_by_bank`, `protect_linked_bank`

[`billed_products`](/docs/api/products/signal/#accounts-balance-get-response-item-billed-products)

[string][string]

A list of products that have been billed for the Item. The contents of this array will be mutually exclusive with `available_products`. Note - `billed_products` is populated in all environments but only requests in Production are billed. Also note that products that are billed on a pay-per-call basis rather than a pay-per-Item basis, such as `balance`, will not appear here.  
  

Possible values: `assets`, `auth`, `balance`, `balance_plus`, `beacon`, `identity`, `identity_match`, `investments`, `investments_auth`, `liabilities`, `payment_initiation`, `identity_verification`, `transactions`, `credit_details`, `income`, `income_verification`, `standing_orders`, `transfer`, `employment`, `recurring_transactions`, `transactions_refresh`, `signal`, `statements`, `processor_payments`, `processor_identity`, `profile`, `cra_base_report`, `cra_income_insights`, `cra_partner_insights`, `cra_network_insights`, `cra_cashflow_insights`, `cra_monitoring`, `cra_lend_score`, `cra_plaid_credit_score`, `layer`, `pay_by_bank`, `protect_linked_bank`

[`products`](/docs/api/products/signal/#accounts-balance-get-response-item-products)

[string][string]

A list of products added to the Item. In almost all cases, this will be the same as the `billed_products` field. For some products, it is possible for the product to be added to an Item but not yet billed (e.g. Assets, before `/asset_report/create` has been called, or Auth or Identity when added as Optional Products but before their endpoints have been called), in which case the product may appear in `products` but not in `billed_products`.  
  

Possible values: `assets`, `auth`, `balance`, `balance_plus`, `beacon`, `identity`, `identity_match`, `investments`, `investments_auth`, `liabilities`, `payment_initiation`, `identity_verification`, `transactions`, `credit_details`, `income`, `income_verification`, `standing_orders`, `transfer`, `employment`, `recurring_transactions`, `transactions_refresh`, `signal`, `statements`, `processor_payments`, `processor_identity`, `profile`, `cra_base_report`, `cra_income_insights`, `cra_partner_insights`, `cra_network_insights`, `cra_cashflow_insights`, `cra_monitoring`, `cra_lend_score`, `cra_plaid_credit_score`, `layer`, `pay_by_bank`, `protect_linked_bank`

[`consented_products`](/docs/api/products/signal/#accounts-balance-get-response-item-consented-products)

[string][string]

A list of products that the user has consented to for the Item via [Data Transparency Messaging](https://plaid.com/docs/link/data-transparency-messaging-migration-guide). This will consist of all products where both of the following are true: the user has consented to the required data scopes for that product and you have Production access for that product.  
  

Possible values: `assets`, `auth`, `balance`, `balance_plus`, `beacon`, `identity`, `identity_match`, `investments`, `investments_auth`, `liabilities`, `transactions`, `income`, `income_verification`, `transfer`, `employment`, `recurring_transactions`, `signal`, `statements`, `processor_payments`, `processor_identity`, `cra_base_report`, `cra_income_insights`, `cra_lend_score`, `cra_partner_insights`, `cra_cashflow_insights`, `cra_monitoring`, `layer`

[`consent_expiration_time`](/docs/api/products/signal/#accounts-balance-get-response-item-consent-expiration-time)

nullablestringnullable, string

The date and time at which the Item's access consent will expire, in [ISO 8601](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format. If the Item does not have consent expiration scheduled, this field will be `null`. Currently, only institutions in Europe and a small number of institutions in the US have expiring consent. For a list of US institutions that currently expire consent, see the [OAuth Guide](https://plaid.com/docs/link/oauth/#refreshing-item-consent).  
  

Format: `date-time`

[`update_type`](/docs/api/products/signal/#accounts-balance-get-response-item-update-type)

stringstring

Indicates whether an Item requires user interaction to be updated, which can be the case for Items with some forms of two-factor authentication.  
`background` - Item can be updated in the background  
`user_present_required` - Item requires user interaction to be updated  
  

Possible values: `background`, `user_present_required`

[`request_id`](/docs/api/products/signal/#accounts-balance-get-response-request-id)

stringstring

A unique identifier for the request, which can be used for troubleshooting. This identifier, like all Plaid identifiers, is case sensitive.
