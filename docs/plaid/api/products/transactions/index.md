#### `/transactions/sync`

If you are migrating to [`/transactions/sync`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactionssync) from an existing [`/transactions/get`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactionsget) integration, also refer to the [Transactions Sync migration guide](/docs/transactions/sync-migration/).

#### Get incremental transaction updates on an Item

The [`/transactions/sync`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactionssync) endpoint retrieves transactions associated with an Item and can fetch updates using a cursor to track which updates have already been seen.

For important instructions on integrating with [`/transactions/sync`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactionssync), see the [Transactions integration overview](https://plaid.com/docs/transactions/#integration-overview). If you are migrating from an existing integration using [`/transactions/get`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactionsget), see the [Transactions Sync migration guide](https://plaid.com/docs/transactions/sync-migration/).

This endpoint supports `credit`, `depository`, and some `loan`-type accounts (only those with account subtype `student`). For `investments` accounts, use [`/investments/transactions/get`](/docs/api/products/investments/#investmentstransactionsget) instead.

When retrieving paginated updates, track both the `next_cursor` from the latest response and the original cursor from the first call in which `has_more` was `true`; if a call to [`/transactions/sync`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactionssync) fails when retrieving a paginated update (e.g due to the [`TRANSACTIONS_SYNC_MUTATION_DURING_PAGINATION`](https://plaid.com/docs/errors/transactions/#transactions_sync_mutation_during_pagination) error), the entire pagination request loop must be restarted beginning with the cursor for the first page of the update, rather than retrying only the single request that failed.

If transactions data is not yet available for the Item, which can happen if the Item was not initialized with transactions during the [`/link/token/create`](/docs/api/link/#linktokencreate) call or if [`/transactions/sync`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactionssync) was called within a few seconds of Item creation, [`/transactions/sync`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactionssync) will return empty transactions arrays.

Plaid typically checks for new transactions data between one and four times per day, depending on the institution. To find out when transactions were last updated for an Item, use the [Item Debugger](https://plaid.com/docs/account/activity/#troubleshooting-with-item-debugger) or call [`/item/get`](/docs/api/items/#itemget); the `item.status.transactions.last_successful_update` field will show the timestamp of the most recent successful update. To force Plaid to check for new transactions, use the [`/transactions/refresh`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactionsrefresh) endpoint.

To be alerted when new transactions are available, listen for the [`SYNC_UPDATES_AVAILABLE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#sync_updates_available) webhook.

/transactions/sync

**Request fields**

[`client_id`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactions-sync-request-client-id)

stringstring

Your Plaid API `client_id`. The `client_id` is required and may be provided either in the `PLAID-CLIENT-ID` header or as part of a request body.

[`access_token`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactions-sync-request-access-token)

requiredstringrequired, string

The access token associated with the Item data is being requested for.

[`secret`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactions-sync-request-secret)

stringstring

Your Plaid API `secret`. The `secret` is required and may be provided either in the `PLAID-SECRET` header or as part of a request body.

[`cursor`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactions-sync-request-cursor)

stringstring

The cursor value represents the last update requested. Providing it will cause the response to only return changes after this update.
If omitted, the entire history of updates will be returned, starting with the first-added transactions on the Item. The cursor also accepts the special value of `"now"`, which can be used to fast-forward the cursor as part of migrating an existing Item from `/transactions/get` to `/transactions/sync`. For more information, see the [Transactions sync migration guide](https://plaid.com/docs/transactions/sync-migration/). Note that using the `"now"` value is not supported for any use case other than migrating existing Items from `/transactions/get`.  
The upper-bound length of this cursor is 256 characters of base64.

[`count`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactions-sync-request-count)

integerinteger

The number of transaction updates to fetch.  
  

Default: `100`

Minimum: `1`

Maximum: `500`

Exclusive min: `false`

[`options`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactions-sync-request-options)

objectobject

An optional object to be used with the request. If specified, `options` must not be `null`.

[`include_original_description`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactions-sync-request-options-include-original-description)

booleanboolean

Include the raw unparsed transaction description from the financial institution.  
  

Default: `false`

[`personal_finance_category_version`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactions-sync-request-options-personal-finance-category-version)

stringstring

Indicates which version of the personal finance category taxonomy is being used. [View PFCv2 and PFCv1 taxonomies](https://plaid.com/documents/pfc-taxonomy-all.csv).  
If you enabled Transactions or Enrich before December 2025 you will receive the `v1` taxonomy by default and may request `v2` by explicitly setting this field to `v2` in the request.  
If you enabled Transactions or Enrich on or after December 2025, you may only receive the `v2` taxonomy.  
  

Possible values: `v1`, `v2`

[`days_requested`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactions-sync-request-options-days-requested)

integerinteger

This field only applies to calls for Items where the Transactions product has not already been initialized (i.e., by specifying `transactions` in the `products`, `required_if_supported_products`, or `optional_products` array when calling `/link/token/create` or by making a previous call to `/transactions/sync` or `/transactions/get`). In those cases, the field controls the maximum number of days of transaction history that Plaid will request from the financial institution. The more transaction history is requested, the longer the historical update poll will take. If no value is specified, 90 days of history will be requested by default. In Production, if a value less than 30 is provided, a minimum of 30 days of transaction history will be requested.  
If you are initializing your Items with transactions during the `/link/token/create` call (e.g. by including `transactions` in the `/link/token/create` `products` array), you must use the [`transactions.days_requested`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/link/#link-token-create-request-transactions-days-requested) field in the `/link/token/create` request instead of in the `/transactions/sync` request.  
If the Item has already been initialized with the Transactions product, this field will have no effect. The maximum amount of transaction history to request on an Item cannot be updated if Transactions has already been added to the Item. To request older transaction history on an Item where Transactions has already been added, you must delete the Item via `/item/remove` and send the user through Link to create a new Item.  
Customers using [Recurring Transactions](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactionsrecurringget) should request at least 180 days of history for optimal results.  
  

Minimum: `1`

Maximum: `730`

Default: `90`

[`account_id`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactions-sync-request-options-account-id)

stringstring

If provided, the returned updates and cursor will only reflect the specified account's transactions. Omitting `account_id` returns updates for all accounts under the Item. Note that specifying an `account_id` effectively creates a separate incremental update stream—and therefore a separate cursor—for that account. If multiple accounts are queried this way, you will maintain multiple cursors, one per `account_id`.  
If you decide to begin filtering by `account_id` after using no `account_id`, start fresh with a null cursor and maintain separate `(account_id, cursor)` pairs going forward. Do not reuse any previously saved cursors, as this can cause pagination errors or incomplete data.  
Note: An error will be returned if a provided `account_id` is not associated with the Item.

/transactions/sync

```
// Provide a cursor from your database if you've previously
// received one for the Item. Leave null if this is your
// first sync call for this Item. The first request will
// return a cursor.
let cursor = database.getLatestCursorOrNull(itemId);

// New transaction updates since "cursor"
let added: Array<Transaction> = [];
let modified: Array<Transaction> = [];
// Removed transaction ids
let removed: Array<RemovedTransaction> = [];
let hasMore = true;

// Iterate through each page of new transaction updates for item
while (hasMore) {
  const request: TransactionsSyncRequest = {
    access_token: accessToken,
    cursor: cursor,
  };
  const response = await client.transactionsSync(request);
  const data = response.data;

  // Add this page of results
  added = added.concat(data.added);
  modified = modified.concat(data.modified);
  removed = removed.concat(data.removed);

  hasMore = data.has_more;

  // Update cursor to the next cursor
  cursor = data.next_cursor;
}

// Persist cursor and updated data
database.applyUpdates(itemId, added, modified, removed, cursor);
```

/transactions/sync

**Response fields**

[`transactions_update_status`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactions-sync-response-transactions-update-status)

stringstring

A description of the update status for transaction pulls of an Item. This field contains the same information provided by transactions webhooks, and may be helpful for webhook troubleshooting or when recovering from missed webhooks.  
`TRANSACTIONS_UPDATE_STATUS_UNKNOWN`: Unable to fetch transactions update status for Item.
`NOT_READY`: The Item is pending transaction pull.
`INITIAL_UPDATE_COMPLETE`: Initial pull for the Item is complete, historical pull is pending.
`HISTORICAL_UPDATE_COMPLETE`: Both initial and historical pull for Item are complete.  
  

Possible values: `TRANSACTIONS_UPDATE_STATUS_UNKNOWN`, `NOT_READY`, `INITIAL_UPDATE_COMPLETE`, `HISTORICAL_UPDATE_COMPLETE`

[`accounts`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactions-sync-response-accounts)

[object][object]

An array of accounts at a financial institution associated with the transactions in this response. Only accounts that have associated transactions will be shown. For example, `investment`-type accounts will be omitted.

[`account_id`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactions-sync-response-accounts-account-id)

stringstring

Plaid’s unique identifier for the account. This value will not change unless Plaid can't reconcile the account with the data returned by the financial institution. This may occur, for example, when the name of the account changes. If this happens a new `account_id` will be assigned to the account.  
The `account_id` can also change if the `access_token` is deleted and the same credentials that were used to generate that `access_token` are used to generate a new `access_token` on a later date. In that case, the new `account_id` will be different from the old `account_id`.  
If an account with a specific `account_id` disappears instead of changing, the account is likely closed. Closed accounts are not returned by the Plaid API.  
When using a CRA endpoint (an endpoint associated with Plaid Check Consumer Report, i.e. any endpoint beginning with `/cra/`), the `account_id` returned will not match the `account_id` returned by a non-CRA endpoint.  
Like all Plaid identifiers, the `account_id` is case sensitive.

[`balances`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactions-sync-response-accounts-balances)

objectobject

A set of fields describing the balance for an account. Balance information may be cached unless the balance object was returned by `/accounts/balance/get` or `/signal/evaluate` (using a Balance-only ruleset).

[`available`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactions-sync-response-accounts-balances-available)

nullablenumbernullable, number

The amount of funds available to be withdrawn from the account, as determined by the financial institution.  
For `credit`-type accounts, the `available` balance typically equals the `limit` less the `current` balance, less any pending outflows plus any pending inflows.  
For `depository`-type accounts, the `available` balance typically equals the `current` balance less any pending outflows plus any pending inflows. For `depository`-type accounts, the `available` balance does not include the overdraft limit.  
For `investment`-type accounts (or `brokerage`-type accounts for API versions 2018-05-22 and earlier), the `available` balance is the total cash available to withdraw as presented by the institution.  
Note that not all institutions calculate the `available` balance. In the event that `available` balance is unavailable, Plaid will return an `available` balance value of `null`.  
Available balance may be cached and is not guaranteed to be up-to-date in realtime unless the value was returned by `/accounts/balance/get`, or by `/signal/evaluate` with a Balance-only ruleset.  
If `current` is `null` this field is guaranteed not to be `null`.  
  

Format: `double`

[`current`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactions-sync-response-accounts-balances-current)

nullablenumbernullable, number

The total amount of funds in or owed by the account.  
For `credit`-type accounts, a positive balance indicates the amount owed; a negative amount indicates the lender owing the account holder.  
For `loan`-type accounts, the current balance is the principal remaining on the loan, except in the case of student loan accounts at Sallie Mae (`ins_116944`). For Sallie Mae student loans, the account's balance includes both principal and any outstanding interest. Similar to `credit`-type accounts, a positive balance is typically expected, while a negative amount indicates the lender owing the account holder.  
For `investment`-type accounts (or `brokerage`-type accounts for API versions 2018-05-22 and earlier), the current balance is the total value of assets as presented by the institution.  
Note that balance information may be cached unless the value was returned by `/accounts/balance/get` or by `/signal/evaluate` with a Balance-only ruleset; if the Item is enabled for Transactions, the balance will be at least as recent as the most recent Transaction update. If you require realtime balance information, use the `available` balance as provided by `/accounts/balance/get` or `/signal/evaluate` called with a Balance-only `ruleset_key`.  
When returned by `/accounts/balance/get`, this field may be `null`. When this happens, `available` is guaranteed not to be `null`.  
  

Format: `double`

[`limit`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactions-sync-response-accounts-balances-limit)

nullablenumbernullable, number

For `credit`-type accounts, this represents the credit limit.  
For `depository`-type accounts, this represents the pre-arranged overdraft limit, which is common for current (checking) accounts in Europe.  
In North America, this field is typically only available for `credit`-type accounts.  
  

Format: `double`

[`iso_currency_code`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactions-sync-response-accounts-balances-iso-currency-code)

nullablestringnullable, string

The ISO-4217 currency code of the balance. Always null if `unofficial_currency_code` is non-null.

[`unofficial_currency_code`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactions-sync-response-accounts-balances-unofficial-currency-code)

nullablestringnullable, string

The unofficial currency code associated with the balance. Always null if `iso_currency_code` is non-null. Unofficial currency codes are used for currencies that do not have official ISO currency codes, such as cryptocurrencies and the currencies of certain countries.  
See the [currency code schema](https://plaid.com/docs/api/accounts#currency-code-schema) for a full listing of supported `unofficial_currency_code`s.

[`last_updated_datetime`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactions-sync-response-accounts-balances-last-updated-datetime)

nullablestringnullable, string

Timestamp in [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format (`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ`) indicating the last time the balance was updated.  
This field is returned only when the institution is `ins_128026` (Capital One).  
  

Format: `date-time`

[`mask`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactions-sync-response-accounts-mask)

nullablestringnullable, string

The last 2-4 alphanumeric characters of either the account’s displayed mask or the account’s official account number. Note that the mask may be non-unique between an Item’s accounts.

[`name`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactions-sync-response-accounts-name)

stringstring

The name of the account, either assigned by the user or by the financial institution itself

[`official_name`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactions-sync-response-accounts-official-name)

nullablestringnullable, string

The official name of the account as given by the financial institution

[`type`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactions-sync-response-accounts-type)

`credit:` Credit card  
`depository:` Depository account  
`loan:` Loan account  
`other:` Non-specified account type  
See the [Account type schema](https://plaid.com/docs/api/accounts#account-type-schema) for a full listing of account types and corresponding subtypes.  
  

Possible values: `investment`, `credit`, `depository`, `loan`, `brokerage`, `other`

[`subtype`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactions-sync-response-accounts-subtype)

[`verification_status`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactions-sync-response-accounts-verification-status)

stringstring

Indicates an Item's micro-deposit-based verification or database verification status. This field is only populated when using Auth and falling back to micro-deposit or database verification. Possible values are:  
`pending_automatic_verification`: The Item is pending automatic verification.  
`pending_manual_verification`: The Item is pending manual micro-deposit verification. Items remain in this state until the user successfully verifies the code.  
`automatically_verified`: The Item has successfully been automatically verified.  
`manually_verified`: The Item has successfully been manually verified.  
`verification_expired`: Plaid was unable to automatically verify the deposit within 7 calendar days and will no longer attempt to validate the Item. Users may retry by submitting their information again through Link.  
`verification_failed`: The Item failed manual micro-deposit verification because the user exhausted all 3 verification attempts. Users may retry by submitting their information again through Link.  
`unsent`: The Item is pending micro-deposit verification, but Plaid has not yet sent the micro-deposit.  
`database_insights_pending`: The Database Auth result is pending and will be available upon Auth request.  
`database_insights_fail`: The Item's numbers have been verified using Plaid's data sources and have signal for being invalid and/or have no signal for being valid. Typically this indicates that the routing number is invalid, the account number does not match the account number format associated with the routing number, or the account has been reported as closed or frozen. Only returned for Auth Items created via Database Auth.  
`database_insights_pass`: The Item's numbers have been verified using Plaid's data sources: the routing and account number match a routing and account number of an account recognized on the Plaid network, and the account is not known by Plaid to be frozen or closed. Only returned for Auth Items created via Database Auth.  
`database_insights_pass_with_caution`: The Item's numbers have been verified using Plaid's data sources and have some signal for being valid: the routing and account number were not recognized on the Plaid network, but the routing number is valid and the account number is a potential valid account number for that routing number. Only returned for Auth Items created via Database Auth.  
`database_matched`: (deprecated) The Item has successfully been verified using Plaid's data sources. Only returned for Auth Items created via Database Match.  
`null` or empty string: Neither micro-deposit-based verification nor database verification are being used for the Item.  
  

Possible values: `automatically_verified`, `pending_automatic_verification`, `pending_manual_verification`, `unsent`, `manually_verified`, `verification_expired`, `verification_failed`, `database_matched`, `database_insights_pass`, `database_insights_pass_with_caution`, `database_insights_fail`

[`verification_name`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactions-sync-response-accounts-verification-name)

stringstring

The account holder name that was used for micro-deposit and/or database verification. Only returned for Auth Items created via micro-deposit or database verification. This name was manually-entered by the user during Link, unless it was otherwise provided via the `user.legal_name` request field in `/link/token/create` for the Link session that created the Item.

[`verification_insights`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactions-sync-response-accounts-verification-insights)

objectobject

Insights from performing database verification for the account. Only returned for Auth Items using Database Auth.

[`name_match_score`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactions-sync-response-accounts-verification-insights-name-match-score)

nullableintegernullable, integer

Indicates the score of the name match between the given name provided during database verification (available in the [`verification_name`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/auth/#auth-get-response-accounts-verification-name) field if using standard Database Auth, or provided in the request if using `/auth/verify`) and matched Plaid network accounts. If defined, will be a value between 0 and 100. Will be undefined if name matching was not enabled for the database verification session or if there were no eligible Plaid network matches to compare the given name with.

[`network_status`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactions-sync-response-accounts-verification-insights-network-status)

objectobject

Status information about the account and routing number in the Plaid network.

[`has_numbers_match`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactions-sync-response-accounts-verification-insights-network-status-has-numbers-match)

[`previous_returns`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactions-sync-response-accounts-verification-insights-previous-returns)

objectobject

Information about known ACH returns for the account and routing number.

[`has_previous_administrative_return`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactions-sync-response-accounts-verification-insights-previous-returns-has-previous-administrative-return)

booleanboolean

Indicates whether Plaid's data sources include a known administrative ACH return for this account and routing number.

[`account_number_format`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactions-sync-response-accounts-verification-insights-account-number-format)

stringstring

Indicator of account number format validity for institution.  
`valid`: indicates that the account number has a correct format for the institution.  
`invalid`: indicates that the account number has an incorrect format for the institution.  
`unknown`: indicates that there was not enough information to determine whether the format is correct for the institution.  
  

Possible values: `valid`, `invalid`, `unknown`

[`persistent_account_id`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactions-sync-response-accounts-persistent-account-id)

stringstring

A unique and persistent identifier for accounts that can be used to trace multiple instances of the same account across different Items for depository accounts. This field is currently supported only for Items at institutions that use Tokenized Account Numbers (i.e., Chase and PNC, and in May 2025 US Bank). Because these accounts have a different account number each time they are linked, this field may be used instead of the account number to uniquely identify an account across multiple Items for payments use cases, helping to reduce duplicate Items or attempted fraud. In Sandbox, this field is populated for TAN-based institutions (`ins_56`, `ins_13`) as well as the OAuth Sandbox institution (`ins_127287`); in Production, it will only be populated for accounts at applicable institutions.

[`holder_category`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactions-sync-response-accounts-holder-category)

[`amount`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactions-sync-response-added-amount)

numbernumber

The settled value of the transaction, denominated in the transactions's currency, as stated in `iso_currency_code` or `unofficial_currency_code`. For all products except Income: Positive values when money moves out of the account; negative values when money moves in. For example, debit card purchases are positive; credit card payments, direct deposits, and refunds are negative. For Income endpoints, values are positive when representing income.  
  

Format: `double`

[`iso_currency_code`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactions-sync-response-added-iso-currency-code)

nullablestringnullable, string

The ISO-4217 currency code of the transaction. Always `null` if `unofficial_currency_code` is non-null.

[`unofficial_currency_code`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactions-sync-response-added-unofficial-currency-code)

nullablestringnullable, string

The unofficial currency code associated with the transaction. Always `null` if `iso_currency_code` is non-`null`. Unofficial currency codes are used for currencies that do not have official ISO currency codes, such as cryptocurrencies and the currencies of certain countries.  
See the [currency code schema](https://plaid.com/docs/api/accounts#currency-code-schema) for a full listing of supported `iso_currency_code`s.

[`check_number`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactions-sync-response-added-check-number)

Both dates are returned in an [ISO 8601](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format ( `YYYY-MM-DD` ). To receive information about the date that a posted transaction was initiated, see the `authorized_date` field.  
  

Format: `date`

[`location`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactions-sync-response-added-location)

#### `/transactions/get`

#### Get transaction data

Note: All new implementations are encouraged to use [`/transactions/sync`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactionssync) rather than [`/transactions/get`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactionsget). [`/transactions/sync`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactionssync) provides the same functionality as [`/transactions/get`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactionsget) and improves developer ease-of-use for handling transactions updates.

The [`/transactions/get`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactionsget) endpoint allows developers to receive user-authorized transaction data for credit, depository, and some loan-type accounts (only those with account subtype `student`; coverage may be limited). For transaction history from investments accounts, use the [Investments endpoint](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/investments/) instead. Transaction data is standardized across financial institutions, and in many cases transactions are linked to a clean name, entity type, location, and category. Similarly, account data is standardized and returned with a clean name, number, balance, and other meta information where available.

Transactions are returned in reverse-chronological order, and the sequence of transaction ordering is stable and will not shift. Transactions are not immutable and can also be removed altogether by the institution; a removed transaction will no longer appear in [`/transactions/get`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactionsget). For more details, see [Pending and posted transactions](https://plaid.com/docs/transactions/transactions-data/#pending-and-posted-transactions).

Due to the potentially large number of transactions associated with an Item, results are paginated. Manipulate the `count` and `offset` parameters in conjunction with the `total_transactions` response body field to fetch all available transactions.

Data returned by [`/transactions/get`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactionsget) will be the data available for the Item as of the most recent successful check for new transactions. Plaid typically checks for new data multiple times a day, but these checks may occur less frequently, such as once a day, depending on the institution. To find out when the Item was last updated, use the [Item Debugger](https://plaid.com/docs/account/activity/#troubleshooting-with-item-debugger) or call [`/item/get`](/docs/api/items/#itemget); the `item.status.transactions.last_successful_update` field will show the timestamp of the most recent successful update. To force Plaid to check for new transactions, you can use the [`/transactions/refresh`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactionsrefresh) endpoint.

Note that data may not be immediately available to [`/transactions/get`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactionsget). Plaid will begin to prepare transactions data upon Item link, if Link was initialized with `transactions`, or upon the first call to [`/transactions/get`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactionsget), if it wasn't. To be alerted when transaction data is ready to be fetched, listen for the [`INITIAL_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#initial_update) and [`HISTORICAL_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#historical_update) webhooks. If no transaction history is ready when [`/transactions/get`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactionsget) is called, it will return a `PRODUCT_NOT_READY` error.

/transactions/get

**Request fields**

[`client_id`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactions-get-request-client-id)

stringstring

Your Plaid API `client_id`. The `client_id` is required and may be provided either in the `PLAID-CLIENT-ID` header or as part of a request body.

[`options`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactions-get-request-options)

objectobject

An optional object to be used with the request. If specified, `options` must not be `null`.

[`account_ids`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactions-get-request-options-account-ids)

[string][string]

A list of `account_ids` to retrieve for the Item  
Note: An error will be returned if a provided `account_id` is not associated with the Item.

[`count`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactions-get-request-options-count)

integerinteger

The number of transactions to fetch.  
  

Default: `100`

Minimum: `1`

Maximum: `500`

Exclusive min: `false`

[`offset`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactions-get-request-options-offset)

integerinteger

The number of transactions to skip. The default value is 0.  
  

Default: `0`

Minimum: `0`

[`include_original_description`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactions-get-request-options-include-original-description)

booleanboolean

Include the raw unparsed transaction description from the financial institution.  
  

Default: `false`

[`personal_finance_category_version`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactions-get-request-options-personal-finance-category-version)

stringstring

Indicates which version of the personal finance category taxonomy is being used. [View PFCv2 and PFCv1 taxonomies](https://plaid.com/documents/pfc-taxonomy-all.csv).  
If you enabled Transactions or Enrich before December 2025 you will receive the `v1` taxonomy by default and may request `v2` by explicitly setting this field to `v2` in the request.  
If you enabled Transactions or Enrich on or after December 2025, you may only receive the `v2` taxonomy.  
  

Possible values: `v1`, `v2`

[`days_requested`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactions-get-request-options-days-requested)

integerinteger

This field only applies to calls for Items where the Transactions product has not already been initialized (i.e. by specifying `transactions` in the `products`, `optional_products`, or `required_if_consented_products` array when calling `/link/token/create` or by making a previous call to `/transactions/sync` or `/transactions/get`). In those cases, the field controls the maximum number of days of transaction history that Plaid will request from the financial institution. The more transaction history is requested, the longer the historical update poll will take. If no value is specified, 90 days of history will be requested by default. In Production, if a value under 30 is provided, a minimum of 30 days of history will be requested.  
If you are initializing your Items with transactions during the `/link/token/create` call (e.g. by including `transactions` in the `/link/token/create` `products` array), you must use the [`transactions.days_requested`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/link/#link-token-create-request-transactions-days-requested) field in the `/link/token/create` request instead of in the `/transactions/get` request.  
If the Item has already been initialized with the Transactions product, this field will have no effect. The maximum amount of transaction history to request on an Item cannot be updated if Transactions has already been added to the Item. To request older transaction history on an Item where Transactions has already been added, you must delete the Item via `/item/remove` and send the user through Link to create a new Item.  
Customers using [Recurring Transactions](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactionsrecurringget) should request at least 180 days of history for optimal results.  
  

Minimum: `1`

Maximum: `730`

Default: `90`

[`access_token`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactions-get-request-access-token)

requiredstringrequired, string

**Response fields**

[`accounts`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactions-get-response-accounts)

[object][object]

An array containing the `accounts` associated with the Item for which transactions are being returned. Each transaction can be mapped to its corresponding account via the `account_id` field.

[`account_id`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactions-get-response-accounts-account-id)

stringstring

Plaid’s unique identifier for the account. This value will not change unless Plaid can't reconcile the account with the data returned by the financial institution. This may occur, for example, when the name of the account changes. If this happens a new `account_id` will be assigned to the account.  
The `account_id` can also change if the `access_token` is deleted and the same credentials that were used to generate that `access_token` are used to generate a new `access_token` on a later date. In that case, the new `account_id` will be different from the old `account_id`.  
If an account with a specific `account_id` disappears instead of changing, the account is likely closed. Closed accounts are not returned by the Plaid API.  
When using a CRA endpoint (an endpoint associated with Plaid Check Consumer Report, i.e. any endpoint beginning with `/cra/`), the `account_id` returned will not match the `account_id` returned by a non-CRA endpoint.  
Like all Plaid identifiers, the `account_id` is case sensitive.

[`balances`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactions-get-response-accounts-balances)

objectobject

A set of fields describing the balance for an account. Balance information may be cached unless the balance object was returned by `/accounts/balance/get` or `/signal/evaluate` (using a Balance-only ruleset).

[`available`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactions-get-response-accounts-balances-available)

nullablenumbernullable, number

The amount of funds available to be withdrawn from the account, as determined by the financial institution.  
For `credit`-type accounts, the `available` balance typically equals the `limit` less the `current` balance, less any pending outflows plus any pending inflows.  
For `depository`-type accounts, the `available` balance typically equals the `current` balance less any pending outflows plus any pending inflows. For `depository`-type accounts, the `available` balance does not include the overdraft limit.  
For `investment`-type accounts (or `brokerage`-type accounts for API versions 2018-05-22 and earlier), the `available` balance is the total cash available to withdraw as presented by the institution.  
Note that not all institutions calculate the `available` balance. In the event that `available` balance is unavailable, Plaid will return an `available` balance value of `null`.  
Available balance may be cached and is not guaranteed to be up-to-date in realtime unless the value was returned by `/accounts/balance/get`, or by `/signal/evaluate` with a Balance-only ruleset.  
If `current` is `null` this field is guaranteed not to be `null`.  
  

Format: `double`

[`current`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactions-get-response-accounts-balances-current)

nullablenumbernullable, number

The total amount of funds in or owed by the account.  
For `credit`-type accounts, a positive balance indicates the amount owed; a negative amount indicates the lender owing the account holder.  
For `loan`-type accounts, the current balance is the principal remaining on the loan, except in the case of student loan accounts at Sallie Mae (`ins_116944`). For Sallie Mae student loans, the account's balance includes both principal and any outstanding interest. Similar to `credit`-type accounts, a positive balance is typically expected, while a negative amount indicates the lender owing the account holder.  
For `investment`-type accounts (or `brokerage`-type accounts for API versions 2018-05-22 and earlier), the current balance is the total value of assets as presented by the institution.  
Note that balance information may be cached unless the value was returned by `/accounts/balance/get` or by `/signal/evaluate` with a Balance-only ruleset; if the Item is enabled for Transactions, the balance will be at least as recent as the most recent Transaction update. If you require realtime balance information, use the `available` balance as provided by `/accounts/balance/get` or `/signal/evaluate` called with a Balance-only `ruleset_key`.  
When returned by `/accounts/balance/get`, this field may be `null`. When this happens, `available` is guaranteed not to be `null`.  
  

Format: `double`

[`limit`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactions-get-response-accounts-balances-limit)

nullablenumbernullable, number

For `credit`-type accounts, this represents the credit limit.  
For `depository`-type accounts, this represents the pre-arranged overdraft limit, which is common for current (checking) accounts in Europe.  
In North America, this field is typically only available for `credit`-type accounts.  
  

Format: `double`

[`iso_currency_code`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactions-get-response-accounts-balances-iso-currency-code)

nullablestringnullable, string

The ISO-4217 currency code of the balance. Always null if `unofficial_currency_code` is non-null.

[`unofficial_currency_code`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactions-get-response-accounts-balances-unofficial-currency-code)

nullablestringnullable, string

The unofficial currency code associated with the balance. Always null if `iso_currency_code` is non-null. Unofficial currency codes are used for currencies that do not have official ISO currency codes, such as cryptocurrencies and the currencies of certain countries.  
See the [currency code schema](https://plaid.com/docs/api/accounts#currency-code-schema) for a full listing of supported `unofficial_currency_code`s.

[`last_updated_datetime`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactions-get-response-accounts-balances-last-updated-datetime)

nullablestringnullable, string

Timestamp in [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format (`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ`) indicating the last time the balance was updated.  
This field is returned only when the institution is `ins_128026` (Capital One).  
  

Format: `date-time`

[`mask`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactions-get-response-accounts-mask)

nullablestringnullable, string

`pending_automatic_verification`: The Item is pending automatic verification.  
`pending_manual_verification`: The Item is pending manual micro-deposit verification. Items remain in this state until the user successfully verifies the code.  
`automatically_verified`: The Item has successfully been automatically verified.  
`manually_verified`: The Item has successfully been manually verified.  
`verification_expired`: Plaid was unable to automatically verify the deposit within 7 calendar days and will no longer attempt to validate the Item. Users may retry by submitting their information again through Link.

Only returned for Auth Items created via Database Auth.  
`database_insights_pass`: The Item's numbers have been verified using Plaid's data sources: the routing and account number match a routing and account number of an account recognized on the Plaid network, and the account is not known by Plaid to be frozen or closed. Only returned for Auth Items created via Database Auth.  
`database_insights_pass_with_caution`: The Item's numbers have been verified using Plaid's data sources and have some signal for being valid: the routing and account number were not recognized on the Plaid network, but the routing number is valid and the account number is a potential valid account number for that routing number. Only returned for Auth Items created via Database Auth.  
`database_matched`: (deprecated) The Item has successfully been verified using Plaid's data sources. Only returned for Auth Items created via Database Match.

If defined, will be a value between 0 and 100. Will be undefined if name matching was not enabled for the database verification session or if there were no eligible Plaid network matches to compare the given name with.

[`network_status`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactions-get-response-accounts-verification-insights-network-status)

[`persistent_account_id`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactions-get-response-accounts-persistent-account-id)

stringstring

A unique and persistent identifier for accounts that can be used to trace multiple instances of the same account across different Items for depository accounts. This field is currently supported only for Items at institutions that use Tokenized Account Numbers (i.e., Chase and PNC, and in May 2025 US Bank). Because these accounts have a different account number each time they are linked, this field may be used instead of the account number to uniquely identify an account across multiple Items for payments use cases, helping to reduce duplicate Items or attempted fraud. In Sandbox, this field is populated for TAN-based institutions (`ins_56`, `ins_13`) as well as the OAuth Sandbox institution (`ins_127287`); in Production, it will only be populated for accounts at applicable institutions.

[`error`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactions-get-response-item-error)

nullableobjectnullable, object

Errors are identified by `error_code` and categorized by `error_type`. Use these in preference to HTTP status codes to identify and handle specific errors. HTTP status codes are set and provide the broadest categorization of errors: 4xx codes are for developer- or user-related errors, and 5xx codes are for Plaid-related errors, and the status will be 2xx in non-error cases. An Item with a non-`null` error object will only be part of an API response when calling `/item/get` to view Item status. Otherwise, error fields will be `null` if no error has occurred; if an error has occurred, an error code will be returned instead.

#### `/transactions/recurring/get`

#### Fetch recurring transaction streams

The [`/transactions/recurring/get`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactionsrecurringget) endpoint allows developers to receive a summary of the recurring outflow and inflow streams (expenses and deposits) from a user’s checking, savings or credit card accounts. Additionally, Plaid provides key insights about each recurring stream including the category, merchant, last amount, and more. Developers can use these insights to build tools and experiences that help their users better manage cash flow, monitor subscriptions, reduce spend, and stay on track with bill payments.

This endpoint is offered as an add-on to Transactions. To request access to this endpoint, submit a [product access request](https://dashboard.plaid.com/team/products) or contact your Plaid account manager.

This endpoint can only be called on an Item that has already been initialized with Transactions (either during Link, by specifying it in [`/link/token/create`](/docs/api/link/#linktokencreate); or after Link, by calling [`/transactions/get`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactionsget) or [`/transactions/sync`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactionssync)).

When using Recurring Transactions, for best results, make sure to use the [`days_requested`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/link/#link-token-create-request-transactions-days-requested) parameter to request at least 180 days of history when initializing Items with Transactions. Once all historical transactions have been fetched, call [`/transactions/recurring/get`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactionsrecurringget) to receive the Recurring Transactions streams and subscribe to the [`RECURRING_TRANSACTIONS_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#recurring_transactions_update) webhook. To know when historical transactions have been fetched, if you are using [`/transactions/sync`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactionssync) listen for the [`SYNC_UPDATES_AVAILABLE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#SyncUpdatesAvailableWebhook-historical-update-complete) webhook and check that the `historical_update_complete` field in the payload is `true`. If using [`/transactions/get`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactionsget), listen for the [`HISTORICAL_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#historical_update) webhook.

After the initial call, you can call [`/transactions/recurring/get`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactionsrecurringget) endpoint at any point in the future to retrieve the latest summary of recurring streams. Listen to the [`RECURRING_TRANSACTIONS_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#recurring_transactions_update) webhook to be notified when new updates are available.

#### `/transactions/refresh`

#### Refresh transaction data

[`/transactions/refresh`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactionsrefresh) is an optional endpoint that initiates an on-demand extraction to fetch the newest transactions for an Item. The on-demand extraction takes place in addition to the periodic extractions that automatically occur one or more times per day for any Transactions-enabled Item. The Item must already have Transactions added as a product in order to call [`/transactions/refresh`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactionsrefresh).

If changes to transactions are discovered after calling [`/transactions/refresh`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactionsrefresh), Plaid will fire a webhook: for [`/transactions/sync`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactionssync) users, [`SYNC_UPDATES_AVAILABLE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#sync_updates_available) will be fired if there are any transactions updated, added, or removed. For users of both [`/transactions/sync`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactionssync) and [`/transactions/get`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactionsget), [`TRANSACTIONS_REMOVED`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactions_removed) will be fired if any removed transactions are detected, and [`DEFAULT_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#default_update) will be fired if any new transactions are detected. New transactions can be fetched by calling [`/transactions/get`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactionsget) or [`/transactions/sync`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactionssync).

Note that the [`/transactions/refresh`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactionsrefresh) endpoint is not supported for Capital One (`ins_128026`) non-depository accounts and will result in a `PRODUCTS_NOT_SUPPORTED` error if called on an Item that contains only non-depository accounts from that institution.

As this endpoint triggers a synchronous request for fresh data, latency may be higher than for other Plaid endpoints (typically less than 10 seconds, but occasionally up to 30 seconds or more); if you encounter errors, you may find it necessary to adjust your timeout period when making requests.

[`/transactions/refresh`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactionsrefresh) is offered as an optional add-on to Transactions and has a separate [fee model](https://plaid.com/docs/account/billing/#per-request-flat-fee). To request access to this endpoint, submit a [product access request](https://dashboard.plaid.com/team/products) or contact your Plaid account manager.

### Webhooks

You can receive notifications via a webhook whenever there are new transactions associated with an Item, including when Plaid’s initial and historical transaction pull are completed. All webhooks related to transactions have a `webhook_type` of `TRANSACTIONS`.

=\*=\*=\*=

#### `SYNC_UPDATES_AVAILABLE`

Fired when an Item's transactions change. This can be due to any event resulting in new changes, such as an initial 30-day transactions fetch upon the initialization of an Item with transactions, the backfill of historical transactions that occurs shortly after, or when changes are populated from a regularly-scheduled transactions update job. It is recommended to listen for the `SYNC_UPDATES_AVAILABLE` webhook when using the [`/transactions/sync`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactionssync) endpoint. Note that when using [`/transactions/sync`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactionssync) the older webhooks `INITIAL_UPDATE`, `HISTORICAL_UPDATE`, `DEFAULT_UPDATE`, and `TRANSACTIONS_REMOVED`, which are intended for use with [`/transactions/get`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactionsget), will also continue to be sent in order to maintain backwards compatibility. It is not necessary to listen for and respond to those webhooks when using [`/transactions/sync`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactionssync).

After receipt of this webhook, the new changes can be fetched for the Item from [`/transactions/sync`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactionssync).

Note that to receive this webhook for an Item, [`/transactions/sync`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactionssync) must have been called at least once on that Item. This means that, unlike the `INITIAL_UPDATE` and `HISTORICAL_UPDATE` webhooks, it will not fire immediately upon Item creation. If [`/transactions/sync`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactionssync) is called on an Item that was *not* initialized with Transactions, the webhook will fire twice: once the first 30 days of transactions data has been fetched, and a second time when all available historical transactions data has been fetched.

This webhook will fire in the Sandbox environment as it would in Production. It can also be manually triggered in Sandbox by calling [`/sandbox/item/fire_webhook`](/docs/api/sandbox/#sandboxitemfire_webhook).

#### `RECURRING_TRANSACTIONS_UPDATE`

Fired when recurring transactions data is updated. This includes when a new recurring stream is detected or when a new transaction is added to an existing recurring stream. The `RECURRING_TRANSACTIONS_UPDATE` webhook will also fire when one or more attributes of the recurring stream changes, which is usually a result of the addition, update, or removal of transactions to the stream.

After receipt of this webhook, the updated data can be fetched from [`/transactions/recurring/get`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactionsrecurringget).

This webhook will also be fired if account selections for the Item are updated, with `new_transactions` set to the number of net new transactions pulled after the account selection update.

This webhook is intended for use with [`/transactions/get`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactionsget); if you are using the newer [`/transactions/sync`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactionssync) endpoint, this webhook will still be fired to maintain backwards compatibility, but it is recommended to listen for and respond to the `SYNC_UPDATES_AVAILABLE` webhook instead.

=\*=\*=\*=

#### `HISTORICAL_UPDATE`

Fired when an Item's historical transaction pull is completed and Plaid has prepared as much historical transaction data as possible for the Item. Once this webhook has been fired, transaction data beyond the most recent 30 days can be fetched for the Item. This webhook will also be fired if account selections for the Item are updated, with `new_transactions` set to the number of net new transactions pulled after the account selection update.

This webhook is intended for use with [`/transactions/get`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactionsget); if you are using the newer [`/transactions/sync`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactionssync) endpoint, this webhook will still be fired to maintain backwards compatibility, but it is recommended to listen for and respond to the `SYNC_UPDATES_AVAILABLE` webhook instead.

[`error`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#HistoricalUpdateWebhook-error)

objectobject

Errors are identified by `error_code` and categorized by `error_type`. Use these in preference to HTTP status codes to identify and handle specific errors. HTTP status codes are set and provide the broadest categorization of errors: 4xx codes are for developer- or user-related errors, and 5xx codes are for Plaid-related errors, and the status will be 2xx in non-error cases. An Item with a non-`null` error object will only be part of an API response when calling `/item/get` to view Item status. Otherwise, error fields will be `null` if no error has occurred; if an error has occurred, an error code will be returned instead.

Possible values:
`OAUTH_INVALID_TOKEN`: The user’s OAuth connection to this institution has been invalidated.  
`OAUTH_CONSENT_EXPIRED`: The user's access consent for this OAuth connection to this institution has expired.  
`OAUTH_USER_REVOKED`: The user’s OAuth connection to this institution is invalid because the user revoked their connection.

[`error_message`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#HistoricalUpdateWebhook-error-error-message)

#### `DEFAULT_UPDATE`

Fired when new transaction data is available for an Item. Plaid will typically check for new transaction data several times a day.

This webhook is intended for use with [`/transactions/get`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactionsget); if you are using the newer [`/transactions/sync`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactionssync) endpoint, this webhook will still be fired to maintain backwards compatibility, but it is recommended to listen for and respond to the `SYNC_UPDATES_AVAILABLE` webhook instead.

Fired when transaction(s) for an Item are deleted. The deleted transaction IDs are included in the webhook payload. Plaid will typically check for deleted transaction data several times a day.

This webhook is intended for use with [`/transactions/get`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactionsget); if you are using the newer [`/transactions/sync`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactionssync) endpoint, this webhook will still be fired to maintain backwards compatibility, but it is recommended to listen for and respond to the `SYNC_UPDATES_AVAILABLE` webhook instead.

[`error`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#TransactionsRemovedWebhook-error)

objectobject

Errors are identified by `error_code` and categorized by `error_type`. Use these in preference to HTTP status codes to identify and handle specific errors. HTTP status codes are set and provide the broadest categorization of errors: 4xx codes are for developer- or user-related errors, and 5xx codes are for Plaid-related errors, and the status will be 2xx in non-error cases. An Item with a non-`null` error object will only be part of an API response when calling `/item/get` to view Item status. Otherwise, error fields will be `null` if no error has occurred; if an error has occurred, an error code will be returned instead.

[`error_type`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#TransactionsRemovedWebhook-error-error-type)

stringstring

A broad categorization of the error. Safe for programmatic use.  
  

Possible values: `INVALID_REQUEST`, `INVALID_RESULT`, `INVALID_INPUT`, `INSTITUTION_ERROR`, `RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED`, `API_ERROR`, `ITEM_ERROR`, `ASSET_REPORT_ERROR`, `RECAPTCHA_ERROR`, `OAUTH_ERROR`, `PAYMENT_ERROR`, `BANK_TRANSFER_ERROR`, `INCOME_VERIFICATION_ERROR`, `MICRODEPOSITS_ERROR`, `SANDBOX_ERROR`, `PARTNER_ERROR`, `SIGNAL_ERROR`, `TRANSACTIONS_ERROR`, `TRANSACTION_ERROR`, `TRANSFER_ERROR`, `CHECK_REPORT_ERROR`, `CONSUMER_REPORT_ERROR`, `USER_ERROR`

[`error_code`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#TransactionsRemovedWebhook-error-error-code)

stringstring

The particular error code. Safe for programmatic use.

[`error_code_reason`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#TransactionsRemovedWebhook-error-error-code-reason)

stringstring

The specific reason for the error code. Currently, reasons are only supported OAuth-based item errors; `null` will be returned otherwise. Safe for programmatic use.  
Possible values:
`OAUTH_INVALID_TOKEN`: The user’s OAuth connection to this institution has been invalidated.  
`OAUTH_CONSENT_EXPIRED`: The user's access consent for this OAuth connection to this institution has expired.  
`OAUTH_USER_REVOKED`: The user’s OAuth connection to this institution is invalid because the user revoked their connection.

[`error_message`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#TransactionsRemovedWebhook-error-error-message)

stringstring

A developer-friendly representation of the error code. This may change over time and is not safe for programmatic use.

[`display_message`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#TransactionsRemovedWebhook-error-display-message)

stringstring

A user-friendly representation of the error code. `null` if the error is not related to user action.  
This may change over time and is not safe for programmatic use.

[`request_id`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#TransactionsRemovedWebhook-error-request-id)

stringstring

A unique ID identifying the request, to be used for troubleshooting purposes. This field will be omitted in errors provided by webhooks.

[`causes`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#TransactionsRemovedWebhook-error-causes)

arrayarray

In this product, a request can pertain to more than one Item. If an error is returned for such a request, `causes` will return an array of errors containing a breakdown of these errors on the individual Item level, if any can be identified.  
`causes` will be provided for the `error_type` `ASSET_REPORT_ERROR` or `CHECK_REPORT_ERROR`. `causes` will also not be populated inside an error nested within a `warning` object.

[`status`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#TransactionsRemovedWebhook-error-status)

integerinteger

The HTTP status code associated with the error. This will only be returned in the response body when the error information is provided via a webhook.

[`documentation_url`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#TransactionsRemovedWebhook-error-documentation-url)

stringstring

The URL of a Plaid documentation page with more information about the error

[`suggested_action`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#TransactionsRemovedWebhook-error-suggested-action)

stringstring

Suggested steps for resolving the error
