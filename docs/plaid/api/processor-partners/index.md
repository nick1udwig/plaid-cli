# Processor partner endpoints

#### API reference for endpoints for use by Plaid partners

Partner processor endpoints are used by Plaid partners to integrate with Plaid. Instead of using an `access_token` associated with a Plaid `Item`, these endpoints use a `processor_token` to identify a single financial account. These endpoints are used only by partners and not by developers who are using those partners' APIs. If you are a Plaid developer who would like to use a partner, see [Processor token endpoints](/docs/api/processors/). To learn how to move money with one of our partners, see [Move money with Auth](/docs/auth/partnerships/).

#### `/processor/account/get`

#### Retrieve the account associated with a processor token

This endpoint returns the account associated with a given processor token.

This endpoint retrieves cached information, rather than extracting fresh information from the institution. As a result, the account balance returned may not be up-to-date; for realtime balance information, use [`/processor/balance/get`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processorbalanceget) instead. Note that some information is nullable.

/processor/account/get

**Request fields**

[`client_id`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-account-get-request-client-id)

stringstring

Your Plaid API `client_id`. The `client_id` is required and may be provided either in the `PLAID-CLIENT-ID` header or as part of a request body.

[`processor_token`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-account-get-request-processor-token)

requiredstringrequired, string

The processor token obtained from the Plaid integration partner. Processor tokens are in the format: `processor-<environment>-<identifier>`

[`secret`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-account-get-request-secret)

stringstring

Your Plaid API `secret`. The `secret` is required and may be provided either in the `PLAID-SECRET` header or as part of a request body.

/processor/account/get

```
try {
  const request: ProcessorAccountGetRequest = {
    processor_token: processorToken,
  };
  const response = await plaidClient.processorAccountGet(request);
} catch (error) {
  // handle error
}
```

/processor/account/get

**Response fields**

[`account`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-account-get-response-account)

objectobject

A single account at a financial institution.

[`account_id`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-account-get-response-account-account-id)

stringstring

Plaid’s unique identifier for the account. This value will not change unless Plaid can't reconcile the account with the data returned by the financial institution. This may occur, for example, when the name of the account changes. If this happens a new `account_id` will be assigned to the account.  
The `account_id` can also change if the `access_token` is deleted and the same credentials that were used to generate that `access_token` are used to generate a new `access_token` on a later date. In that case, the new `account_id` will be different from the old `account_id`.  
If an account with a specific `account_id` disappears instead of changing, the account is likely closed. Closed accounts are not returned by the Plaid API.  
When using a CRA endpoint (an endpoint associated with Plaid Check Consumer Report, i.e. any endpoint beginning with `/cra/`), the `account_id` returned will not match the `account_id` returned by a non-CRA endpoint.  
Like all Plaid identifiers, the `account_id` is case sensitive.

[`balances`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-account-get-response-account-balances)

objectobject

A set of fields describing the balance for an account. Balance information may be cached unless the balance object was returned by `/accounts/balance/get` or `/signal/evaluate` (using a Balance-only ruleset).

[`available`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-account-get-response-account-balances-available)

nullablenumbernullable, number

The amount of funds available to be withdrawn from the account, as determined by the financial institution.  
For `credit`-type accounts, the `available` balance typically equals the `limit` less the `current` balance, less any pending outflows plus any pending inflows.  
For `depository`-type accounts, the `available` balance typically equals the `current` balance less any pending outflows plus any pending inflows. For `depository`-type accounts, the `available` balance does not include the overdraft limit.  
For `investment`-type accounts (or `brokerage`-type accounts for API versions 2018-05-22 and earlier), the `available` balance is the total cash available to withdraw as presented by the institution.  
Note that not all institutions calculate the `available` balance. In the event that `available` balance is unavailable, Plaid will return an `available` balance value of `null`.  
Available balance may be cached and is not guaranteed to be up-to-date in realtime unless the value was returned by `/accounts/balance/get`, or by `/signal/evaluate` with a Balance-only ruleset.  
If `current` is `null` this field is guaranteed not to be `null`.  
  

Format: `double`

[`current`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-account-get-response-account-balances-current)

nullablenumbernullable, number

The total amount of funds in or owed by the account.  
For `credit`-type accounts, a positive balance indicates the amount owed; a negative amount indicates the lender owing the account holder.  
For `loan`-type accounts, the current balance is the principal remaining on the loan, except in the case of student loan accounts at Sallie Mae (`ins_116944`). For Sallie Mae student loans, the account's balance includes both principal and any outstanding interest. Similar to `credit`-type accounts, a positive balance is typically expected, while a negative amount indicates the lender owing the account holder.  
For `investment`-type accounts (or `brokerage`-type accounts for API versions 2018-05-22 and earlier), the current balance is the total value of assets as presented by the institution.  
Note that balance information may be cached unless the value was returned by `/accounts/balance/get` or by `/signal/evaluate` with a Balance-only ruleset; if the Item is enabled for Transactions, the balance will be at least as recent as the most recent Transaction update. If you require realtime balance information, use the `available` balance as provided by `/accounts/balance/get` or `/signal/evaluate` called with a Balance-only `ruleset_key`.  
When returned by `/accounts/balance/get`, this field may be `null`. When this happens, `available` is guaranteed not to be `null`.  
  

Format: `double`

[`limit`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-account-get-response-account-balances-limit)

nullablenumbernullable, number

For `credit`-type accounts, this represents the credit limit.  
For `depository`-type accounts, this represents the pre-arranged overdraft limit, which is common for current (checking) accounts in Europe.  
In North America, this field is typically only available for `credit`-type accounts.  
  

Format: `double`

[`iso_currency_code`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-account-get-response-account-balances-iso-currency-code)

nullablestringnullable, string

The ISO-4217 currency code of the balance. Always null if `unofficial_currency_code` is non-null.

[`unofficial_currency_code`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-account-get-response-account-balances-unofficial-currency-code)

nullablestringnullable, string

The unofficial currency code associated with the balance. Always null if `iso_currency_code` is non-null. Unofficial currency codes are used for currencies that do not have official ISO currency codes, such as cryptocurrencies and the currencies of certain countries.  
See the [currency code schema](https://plaid.com/docs/api/accounts#currency-code-schema) for a full listing of supported `unofficial_currency_code`s.

[`last_updated_datetime`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-account-get-response-account-balances-last-updated-datetime)

nullablestringnullable, string

Timestamp in [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format (`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ`) indicating the last time the balance was updated.  
This field is returned only when the institution is `ins_128026` (Capital One).  
  

Format: `date-time`

[`mask`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-account-get-response-account-mask)

nullablestringnullable, string

The last 2-4 alphanumeric characters of either the account’s displayed mask or the account’s official account number. Note that the mask may be non-unique between an Item’s accounts.

[`name`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-account-get-response-account-name)

stringstring

The name of the account, either assigned by the user or by the financial institution itself

[`official_name`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-account-get-response-account-official-name)

nullablestringnullable, string

The official name of the account as given by the financial institution

[`type`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-account-get-response-account-type)

[`verification_status`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-account-get-response-account-verification-status)

stringstring

Indicates an Item's micro-deposit-based verification or database verification status. This field is only populated when using Auth and falling back to micro-deposit or database verification. Possible values are:  
`pending_automatic_verification`: The Item is pending automatic verification.  
`pending_manual_verification`: The Item is pending manual micro-deposit verification. Items remain in this state until the user successfully verifies the code.  
`automatically_verified`: The Item has successfully been automatically verified.  
`manually_verified`: The Item has successfully been manually verified.  
`verification_expired`: Plaid was unable to automatically verify the deposit within 7 calendar days and will no longer attempt to validate the Item. Users may retry by submitting their information again through Link.  
`verification_failed`: The Item failed manual micro-deposit verification because the user exhausted all 3 verification attempts. Users may retry by submitting their information again through Link.  
`unsent`: The Item is pending micro-deposit verification, but Plaid has not yet sent the micro-deposit.  
`database_insights_pending`: The Database Auth result is pending and will be available upon Auth request.  
`database_insights_fail`: The Item's numbers have been verified using Plaid's data sources and have signal for being invalid and/or have no signal for being valid. Typically this indicates that the routing number is invalid, the account number does not match the account number format associated with the routing number, or the account has been reported as closed or frozen. Only returned for Auth Items created via Database Auth.  
`database_insights_pass`: The Item's numbers have been verified using Plaid's data sources: the routing and account number match a routing and account number of an account recognized on the Plaid network, and the account is not known by Plaid to be frozen or closed. Only returned for Auth Items created via Database Auth.  
`database_insights_pass_with_caution`: The Item's numbers have been verified using Plaid's data sources and have some signal for being valid: the routing and account number were not recognized on the Plaid network, but the routing number is valid and the account number is a potential valid account number for that routing number. Only returned for Auth Items created via Database Auth.  
`database_matched`: (deprecated) The Item has successfully been verified using Plaid's data sources. Only returned for Auth Items created via Database Match.  
`null` or empty string: Neither micro-deposit-based verification nor database verification are being used for the Item.  
  

Possible values: `automatically_verified`, `pending_automatic_verification`, `pending_manual_verification`, `unsent`, `manually_verified`, `verification_expired`, `verification_failed`, `database_matched`, `database_insights_pass`, `database_insights_pass_with_caution`, `database_insights_fail`

[`verification_name`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-account-get-response-account-verification-name)

stringstring

The account holder name that was used for micro-deposit and/or database verification. Only returned for Auth Items created via micro-deposit or database verification. This name was manually-entered by the user during Link, unless it was otherwise provided via the `user.legal_name` request field in `/link/token/create` for the Link session that created the Item.

[`verification_insights`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-account-get-response-account-verification-insights)

objectobject

Insights from performing database verification for the account. Only returned for Auth Items using Database Auth.

[`name_match_score`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-account-get-response-account-verification-insights-name-match-score)

nullableintegernullable, integer

Indicates the score of the name match between the given name provided during database verification (available in the [`verification_name`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/auth/#auth-get-response-accounts-verification-name) field if using standard Database Auth, or provided in the request if using `/auth/verify`) and matched Plaid network accounts. If defined, will be a value between 0 and 100. Will be undefined if name matching was not enabled for the database verification session or if there were no eligible Plaid network matches to compare the given name with.

[`network_status`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-account-get-response-account-verification-insights-network-status)

objectobject

Status information about the account and routing number in the Plaid network.

[`has_numbers_match`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-account-get-response-account-verification-insights-network-status-has-numbers-match)

booleanboolean

Indicates whether we found at least one matching account for the ACH account and routing number.

[`is_numbers_match_verified`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-account-get-response-account-verification-insights-network-status-is-numbers-match-verified)

booleanboolean

Indicates if at least one matching account for the ACH account and routing number is already verified.

[`previous_returns`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-account-get-response-account-verification-insights-previous-returns)

objectobject

Information about known ACH returns for the account and routing number.

[`has_previous_administrative_return`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-account-get-response-account-verification-insights-previous-returns-has-previous-administrative-return)

booleanboolean

Indicates whether Plaid's data sources include a known administrative ACH return for this account and routing number.

[`account_number_format`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-account-get-response-account-verification-insights-account-number-format)

stringstring

Indicator of account number format validity for institution.  
`valid`: indicates that the account number has a correct format for the institution.  
`invalid`: indicates that the account number has an incorrect format for the institution.  
`unknown`: indicates that there was not enough information to determine whether the format is correct for the institution.  
  

Possible values: `valid`, `invalid`, `unknown`

[`persistent_account_id`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-account-get-response-account-persistent-account-id)

stringstring

A unique and persistent identifier for accounts that can be used to trace multiple instances of the same account across different Items for depository accounts. This field is currently supported only for Items at institutions that use Tokenized Account Numbers (i.e., Chase and PNC, and in May 2025 US Bank). Because these accounts have a different account number each time they are linked, this field may be used instead of the account number to uniquely identify an account across multiple Items for payments use cases, helping to reduce duplicate Items or attempted fraud. In Sandbox, this field is populated for TAN-based institutions (`ins_56`, `ins_13`) as well as the OAuth Sandbox institution (`ins_127287`); in Production, it will only be populated for accounts at applicable institutions.

[`holder_category`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-account-get-response-account-holder-category)

nullablestringnullable, string

Indicates the account's categorization as either a personal or a business account. This field is currently in beta; to request access, contact your account manager.  
  

Possible values: `business`, `personal`, `unrecognized`

stringstring

The Plaid Institution ID associated with the Account.

[`request_id`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-account-get-response-request-id)

stringstring

A unique identifier for the request, which can be used for troubleshooting. This identifier, like all Plaid identifiers, is case sensitive.

#### `/processor/auth/get`

#### Retrieve Auth data

The [`/processor/auth/get`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processorauthget) endpoint returns the bank account and bank identification number (such as the routing number, for US accounts), for a checking, savings, or cash management account that''s associated with a given `processor_token`. The endpoint also returns high-level account data and balances when available.

Versioning note: API versions 2019-05-29 and earlier use a different schema for the `numbers` object returned by this endpoint. For details, see [Plaid API versioning](https://plaid.com/docs/api/versioning/#version-2020-09-14).

/processor/auth/get

**Request fields**

The `account_id` can also change if the `access_token` is deleted and the same credentials that were used to generate that `access_token` are used to generate a new `access_token` on a later date. In that case, the new `account_id` will be different from the old `account_id`.  
If an account with a specific `account_id` disappears instead of changing, the account is likely closed. Closed accounts are not returned by the Plaid API.  
When using a CRA endpoint (an endpoint associated with Plaid Check Consumer Report, i.e. any endpoint beginning with `/cra/`), the `account_id` returned will not match the `account_id` returned by a non-CRA endpoint.  
Like all Plaid identifiers, the `account_id` is case sensitive.

[`balances`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-auth-get-response-account-balances)

objectobject

A set of fields describing the balance for an account. Balance information may be cached unless the balance object was returned by `/accounts/balance/get` or `/signal/evaluate` (using a Balance-only ruleset).

[`available`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-auth-get-response-account-balances-available)

nullablenumbernullable, number

The amount of funds available to be withdrawn from the account, as determined by the financial institution.  
For `credit`-type accounts, the `available` balance typically equals the `limit` less the `current` balance, less any pending outflows plus any pending inflows.  
For `depository`-type accounts, the `available` balance typically equals the `current` balance less any pending outflows plus any pending inflows. For `depository`-type accounts, the `available` balance does not include the overdraft limit.  
For `investment`-type accounts (or `brokerage`-type accounts for API versions 2018-05-22 and earlier), the `available` balance is the total cash available to withdraw as presented by the institution.  
Note that not all institutions calculate the `available` balance. In the event that `available` balance is unavailable, Plaid will return an `available` balance value of `null`.  
Available balance may be cached and is not guaranteed to be up-to-date in realtime unless the value was returned by `/accounts/balance/get`, or by `/signal/evaluate` with a Balance-only ruleset.  
If `current` is `null` this field is guaranteed not to be `null`.  
  

Format: `double`

[`current`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-auth-get-response-account-balances-current)

nullablenumbernullable, number

The total amount of funds in or owed by the account.  
For `credit`-type accounts, a positive balance indicates the amount owed; a negative amount indicates the lender owing the account holder.  
For `loan`-type accounts, the current balance is the principal remaining on the loan, except in the case of student loan accounts at Sallie Mae (`ins_116944`). For Sallie Mae student loans, the account's balance includes both principal and any outstanding interest. Similar to `credit`-type accounts, a positive balance is typically expected, while a negative amount indicates the lender owing the account holder.  
For `investment`-type accounts (or `brokerage`-type accounts for API versions 2018-05-22 and earlier), the current balance is the total value of assets as presented by the institution.  
Note that balance information may be cached unless the value was returned by `/accounts/balance/get` or by `/signal/evaluate` with a Balance-only ruleset; if the Item is enabled for Transactions, the balance will be at least as recent as the most recent Transaction update. If you require realtime balance information, use the `available` balance as provided by `/accounts/balance/get` or `/signal/evaluate` called with a Balance-only `ruleset_key`.  
When returned by `/accounts/balance/get`, this field may be `null`. When this happens, `available` is guaranteed not to be `null`.  
  

Format: `double`

[`limit`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-auth-get-response-account-balances-limit)

[`persistent_account_id`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-auth-get-response-account-persistent-account-id)

stringstring

A unique and persistent identifier for accounts that can be used to trace multiple instances of the same account across different Items for depository accounts. This field is currently supported only for Items at institutions that use Tokenized Account Numbers (i.e., Chase and PNC, and in May 2025 US Bank). Because these accounts have a different account number each time they are linked, this field may be used instead of the account number to uniquely identify an account across multiple Items for payments use cases, helping to reduce duplicate Items or attempted fraud. In Sandbox, this field is populated for TAN-based institutions (`ins_56`, `ins_13`) as well as the OAuth Sandbox institution (`ins_127287`); in Production, it will only be populated for accounts at applicable institutions.

#### `/processor/balance/get`

#### Retrieve Balance data

The [`/processor/balance/get`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processorbalanceget) endpoint returns the real-time balance for each of an Item's accounts. While other endpoints may return a balance object, only [`/processor/balance/get`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processorbalanceget) forces the available and current balance fields to be refreshed rather than cached.

/processor/balance/get

**Request fields**

[`client_id`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-balance-get-request-client-id)

stringstring

Your Plaid API `client_id`. The `client_id` is required and may be provided either in the `PLAID-CLIENT-ID` header or as part of a request body.

[`secret`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-balance-get-request-secret)

stringstring

Your Plaid API `secret`. The `secret` is required and may be provided either in the `PLAID-SECRET` header or as part of a request body.

[`processor_token`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-balance-get-request-processor-token)

requiredstringrequired, string

The processor token obtained from the Plaid integration partner. Processor tokens are in the format: `processor-<environment>-<identifier>`

[`options`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-balance-get-request-options)

objectobject

Optional parameters to `/processor/balance/get`.

[`min_last_updated_datetime`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-balance-get-request-options-min-last-updated-datetime)

stringstring

Timestamp in [ISO 8601](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format (`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ`) indicating the oldest acceptable balance when making a request to `/accounts/balance/get`.  
This field is only necessary when the institution is `ins_128026` (Capital One), *and* one or more account types being requested is a non-depository account (such as a credit card) as Capital One does not provide real-time balance for non-depository accounts. In this case, a value must be provided or an `INVALID_REQUEST` error with the code of `INVALID_FIELD` will be returned. For all other institutions, as well as for depository accounts at Capital One (including all checking and savings accounts) this field is ignored and real-time balance information will be fetched.  
If this field is not ignored, and no acceptable balance is available, an `INVALID_RESULT` error with the code `LAST_UPDATED_DATETIME_OUT_OF_RANGE` will be returned.  
  

Format: `date-time`

```
const request: ProcessorBalanceGetRequest = {
  processor_token: processorToken,
};
const response = await plaidClient.processorBalanceGet(request);
```

/processor/balance/get

**Response fields**

[`account`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-balance-get-response-account)

objectobject

A single account at a financial institution.

[`account_id`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-balance-get-response-account-account-id)

stringstring

Plaid’s unique identifier for the account. This value will not change unless Plaid can't reconcile the account with the data returned by the financial institution. This may occur, for example, when the name of the account changes. If this happens a new `account_id` will be assigned to the account.  
The `account_id` can also change if the `access_token` is deleted and the same credentials that were used to generate that `access_token` are used to generate a new `access_token` on a later date. In that case, the new `account_id` will be different from the old `account_id`.  
If an account with a specific `account_id` disappears instead of changing, the account is likely closed. Closed accounts are not returned by the Plaid API.  
When using a CRA endpoint (an endpoint associated with Plaid Check Consumer Report, i.e. any endpoint beginning with `/cra/`), the `account_id` returned will not match the `account_id` returned by a non-CRA endpoint.  
Like all Plaid identifiers, the `account_id` is case sensitive.

[`balances`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-balance-get-response-account-balances)

objectobject

A set of fields describing the balance for an account. Balance information may be cached unless the balance object was returned by `/accounts/balance/get` or `/signal/evaluate` (using a Balance-only ruleset).

[`available`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-balance-get-response-account-balances-available)

nullablenumbernullable, number

The amount of funds available to be withdrawn from the account, as determined by the financial institution.  
For `credit`-type accounts, the `available` balance typically equals the `limit` less the `current` balance, less any pending outflows plus any pending inflows.  
For `depository`-type accounts, the `available` balance typically equals the `current` balance less any pending outflows plus any pending inflows. For `depository`-type accounts, the `available` balance does not include the overdraft limit.  
For `investment`-type accounts (or `brokerage`-type accounts for API versions 2018-05-22 and earlier), the `available` balance is the total cash available to withdraw as presented by the institution.  
Note that not all institutions calculate the `available` balance. In the event that `available` balance is unavailable, Plaid will return an `available` balance value of `null`.  
Available balance may be cached and is not guaranteed to be up-to-date in realtime unless the value was returned by `/accounts/balance/get`, or by `/signal/evaluate` with a Balance-only ruleset.  
If `current` is `null` this field is guaranteed not to be `null`.  
  

Format: `double`

[`current`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-balance-get-response-account-balances-current)

nullablenumbernullable, number

The total amount of funds in or owed by the account.  
For `credit`-type accounts, a positive balance indicates the amount owed; a negative amount indicates the lender owing the account holder.  
For `loan`-type accounts, the current balance is the principal remaining on the loan, except in the case of student loan accounts at Sallie Mae (`ins_116944`). For Sallie Mae student loans, the account's balance includes both principal and any outstanding interest. Similar to `credit`-type accounts, a positive balance is typically expected, while a negative amount indicates the lender owing the account holder.  
For `investment`-type accounts (or `brokerage`-type accounts for API versions 2018-05-22 and earlier), the current balance is the total value of assets as presented by the institution.  
Note that balance information may be cached unless the value was returned by `/accounts/balance/get` or by `/signal/evaluate` with a Balance-only ruleset; if the Item is enabled for Transactions, the balance will be at least as recent as the most recent Transaction update. If you require realtime balance information, use the `available` balance as provided by `/accounts/balance/get` or `/signal/evaluate` called with a Balance-only `ruleset_key`.  
When returned by `/accounts/balance/get`, this field may be `null`. When this happens, `available` is guaranteed not to be `null`.  
  

Format: `double`

[`limit`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-balance-get-response-account-balances-limit)

nullablenumbernullable, number

For `credit`-type accounts, this represents the credit limit.  
For `depository`-type accounts, this represents the pre-arranged overdraft limit, which is common for current (checking) accounts in Europe.  
In North America, this field is typically only available for `credit`-type accounts.  
  

Format: `double`

[`iso_currency_code`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-balance-get-response-account-balances-iso-currency-code)

nullablestringnullable, string

The ISO-4217 currency code of the balance. Always null if `unofficial_currency_code` is non-null.

[`unofficial_currency_code`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-balance-get-response-account-balances-unofficial-currency-code)

nullablestringnullable, string

The unofficial currency code associated with the balance. Always null if `iso_currency_code` is non-null. Unofficial currency codes are used for currencies that do not have official ISO currency codes, such as cryptocurrencies and the currencies of certain countries.  
See the [currency code schema](https://plaid.com/docs/api/accounts#currency-code-schema) for a full listing of supported `unofficial_currency_code`s.

[`last_updated_datetime`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-balance-get-response-account-balances-last-updated-datetime)

Indicates the score of the name match between the given name provided during database verification (available in the [`verification_name`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/auth/#auth-get-response-accounts-verification-name) field if using standard Database Auth, or provided in the request if using `/auth/verify`) and matched Plaid network accounts. If defined, will be a value between 0 and 100. Will be undefined if name matching was not enabled for the database verification session or if there were no eligible Plaid network matches to compare the given name with.

[`network_status`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-balance-get-response-account-verification-insights-network-status)

objectobject

Status information about the account and routing number in the Plaid network.

booleanboolean

Indicates whether we found at least one matching account for the ACH account and routing number.

[`is_numbers_match_verified`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-balance-get-response-account-verification-insights-network-status-is-numbers-match-verified)

booleanboolean

Indicates if at least one matching account for the ACH account and routing number is already verified.

[`previous_returns`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-balance-get-response-account-verification-insights-previous-returns)

A unique and persistent identifier for accounts that can be used to trace multiple instances of the same account across different Items for depository accounts. This field is currently supported only for Items at institutions that use Tokenized Account Numbers (i.e., Chase and PNC, and in May 2025 US Bank). Because these accounts have a different account number each time they are linked, this field may be used instead of the account number to uniquely identify an account across multiple Items for payments use cases, helping to reduce duplicate Items or attempted fraud. In Sandbox, this field is populated for TAN-based institutions (`ins_56`, `ins_13`) as well as the OAuth Sandbox institution (`ins_127287`); in Production, it will only be populated for accounts at applicable institutions.

#### `/processor/identity/get`

#### Retrieve Identity data

The [`/processor/identity/get`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processoridentityget) endpoint allows you to retrieve various account holder information on file with the financial institution, including names, emails, phone numbers, and addresses.

/processor/identity/get

**Request fields**

[`client_id`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-identity-get-request-client-id)

stringstring

Your Plaid API `client_id`. The `client_id` is required and may be provided either in the `PLAID-CLIENT-ID` header or as part of a request body.

[`secret`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-identity-get-request-secret)

stringstring

Your Plaid API `secret`. The `secret` is required and may be provided either in the `PLAID-SECRET` header or as part of a request body.

[`processor_token`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-identity-get-request-processor-token)

requiredstringrequired, string

The processor token obtained from the Plaid integration partner. Processor tokens are in the format: `processor-<environment>-<identifier>`

/processor/identity/get

```
const request: ProcessorIdentityGetRequest = {
  processor_token: processorToken,
};
const response = await plaidClient.processorIdentityGet(request);
```

/processor/identity/get

**Response fields**

[`account`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-identity-get-response-account)

objectobject

Identity information about an account

[`account_id`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-identity-get-response-account-account-id)

stringstring

Plaid’s unique identifier for the account. This value will not change unless Plaid can't reconcile the account with the data returned by the financial institution. This may occur, for example, when the name of the account changes. If this happens a new `account_id` will be assigned to the account.  
The `account_id` can also change if the `access_token` is deleted and the same credentials that were used to generate that `access_token` are used to generate a new `access_token` on a later date. In that case, the new `account_id` will be different from the old `account_id`.  
If an account with a specific `account_id` disappears instead of changing, the account is likely closed. Closed accounts are not returned by the Plaid API.  
When using a CRA endpoint (an endpoint associated with Plaid Check Consumer Report, i.e. any endpoint beginning with `/cra/`), the `account_id` returned will not match the `account_id` returned by a non-CRA endpoint.  
Like all Plaid identifiers, the `account_id` is case sensitive.

[`balances`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-identity-get-response-account-balances)

objectobject

A set of fields describing the balance for an account. Balance information may be cached unless the balance object was returned by `/accounts/balance/get` or `/signal/evaluate` (using a Balance-only ruleset).

[`available`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-identity-get-response-account-balances-available)

nullablenumbernullable, number

The amount of funds available to be withdrawn from the account, as determined by the financial institution.  
For `credit`-type accounts, the `available` balance typically equals the `limit` less the `current` balance, less any pending outflows plus any pending inflows.  
For `depository`-type accounts, the `available` balance typically equals the `current` balance less any pending outflows plus any pending inflows. For `depository`-type accounts, the `available` balance does not include the overdraft limit.  
For `investment`-type accounts (or `brokerage`-type accounts for API versions 2018-05-22 and earlier), the `available` balance is the total cash available to withdraw as presented by the institution.  
Note that not all institutions calculate the `available` balance. In the event that `available` balance is unavailable, Plaid will return an `available` balance value of `null`.  
Available balance may be cached and is not guaranteed to be up-to-date in realtime unless the value was returned by `/accounts/balance/get`, or by `/signal/evaluate` with a Balance-only ruleset.  
If `current` is `null` this field is guaranteed not to be `null`.  
  

Format: `double`

[`current`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-identity-get-response-account-balances-current)

nullablenumbernullable, number

The total amount of funds in or owed by the account.  
For `credit`-type accounts, a positive balance indicates the amount owed; a negative amount indicates the lender owing the account holder.  
For `loan`-type accounts, the current balance is the principal remaining on the loan, except in the case of student loan accounts at Sallie Mae (`ins_116944`). For Sallie Mae student loans, the account's balance includes both principal and any outstanding interest. Similar to `credit`-type accounts, a positive balance is typically expected, while a negative amount indicates the lender owing the account holder.  
For `investment`-type accounts (or `brokerage`-type accounts for API versions 2018-05-22 and earlier), the current balance is the total value of assets as presented by the institution.  
Note that balance information may be cached unless the value was returned by `/accounts/balance/get` or by `/signal/evaluate` with a Balance-only ruleset; if the Item is enabled for Transactions, the balance will be at least as recent as the most recent Transaction update. If you require realtime balance information, use the `available` balance as provided by `/accounts/balance/get` or `/signal/evaluate` called with a Balance-only `ruleset_key`.  
When returned by `/accounts/balance/get`, this field may be `null`. When this happens, `available` is guaranteed not to be `null`.  
  

Format: `double`

[`limit`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-identity-get-response-account-balances-limit)

nullablenumbernullable, number

For `credit`-type accounts, this represents the credit limit.  
For `depository`-type accounts, this represents the pre-arranged overdraft limit, which is common for current (checking) accounts in Europe.  
In North America, this field is typically only available for `credit`-type accounts.  
  

Format: `double`

[`iso_currency_code`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-identity-get-response-account-balances-iso-currency-code)

nullablestringnullable, string

The ISO-4217 currency code of the balance. Always null if `unofficial_currency_code` is non-null.

[`unofficial_currency_code`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-identity-get-response-account-balances-unofficial-currency-code)

nullablestringnullable, string

The unofficial currency code associated with the balance. Always null if `iso_currency_code` is non-null. Unofficial currency codes are used for currencies that do not have official ISO currency codes, such as cryptocurrencies and the currencies of certain countries.  
See the [currency code schema](https://plaid.com/docs/api/accounts#currency-code-schema) for a full listing of supported `unofficial_currency_code`s.

[`last_updated_datetime`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-identity-get-response-account-balances-last-updated-datetime)

nullablestringnullable, string

Timestamp in [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format (`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ`) indicating the last time the balance was updated.  
This field is returned only when the institution is `ins_128026` (Capital One).  
  

Format: `date-time`

[`mask`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-identity-get-response-account-mask)

nullablestringnullable, string

The last 2-4 alphanumeric characters of either the account’s displayed mask or the account’s official account number. Note that the mask may be non-unique between an Item’s accounts.

`pending_automatic_verification`: The Item is pending automatic verification.  
`pending_manual_verification`: The Item is pending manual micro-deposit verification. Items remain in this state until the user successfully verifies the code.  
`automatically_verified`: The Item has successfully been automatically verified.  
`manually_verified`: The Item has successfully been manually verified.  
`verification_expired`: Plaid was unable to automatically verify the deposit within 7 calendar days and will no longer attempt to validate the Item. Users may retry by submitting their information again through Link.  
`verification_failed`: The Item failed manual micro-deposit verification because the user exhausted all 3 verification attempts. Users may retry by submitting their information again through Link.  
`unsent`: The Item is pending micro-deposit verification, but Plaid has not yet sent the micro-deposit.  
`database_insights_pending`: The Database Auth result is pending and will be available upon Auth request.  
`database_insights_fail`: The Item's numbers have been verified using Plaid's data sources and have signal for being invalid and/or have no signal for being valid.

Only returned for Auth Items created via Database Auth.  
`database_insights_pass`: The Item's numbers have been verified using Plaid's data sources: the routing and account number match a routing and account number of an account recognized on the Plaid network, and the account is not known by Plaid to be frozen or closed. Only returned for Auth Items created via Database Auth.  
`database_insights_pass_with_caution`: The Item's numbers have been verified using Plaid's data sources and have some signal for being valid: the routing and account number were not recognized on the Plaid network, but the routing number is valid and the account number is a potential valid account number for that routing number. Only returned for Auth Items created via Database Auth.  
`database_matched`: (deprecated) The Item has successfully been verified using Plaid's data sources. Only returned for Auth Items created via Database Match.

#### `/processor/identity/match`

#### Retrieve identity match score

The [`/processor/identity/match`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processoridentitymatch) endpoint generates a match score, which indicates how well the provided identity data matches the identity information on file with the account holder's financial institution.

Fields within the `balances` object will always be null when retrieved by [`/identity/match`](/docs/api/products/identity/#identitymatch). Instead, use the free [`/accounts/get`](/docs/api/accounts/#accountsget) endpoint to request balance cached data, or [`/accounts/balance/get`](/docs/api/products/signal/#accountsbalanceget) for real-time data.

/processor/identity/match

**Request fields**

[`client_id`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-identity-match-request-client-id)

stringstring

Your Plaid API `client_id`. The `client_id` is required and may be provided either in the `PLAID-CLIENT-ID` header or as part of a request body.

[`secret`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-identity-match-request-secret)

stringstring

Your Plaid API `secret`. The `secret` is required and may be provided either in the `PLAID-SECRET` header or as part of a request body.

[`processor_token`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-identity-match-request-processor-token)

requiredstringrequired, string

The processor token obtained from the Plaid integration partner. Processor tokens are in the format: `processor-<environment>-<identifier>`

[`user`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-identity-match-request-user)

objectobject

The user's legal name, phone number, email address and address used to perform fuzzy match. If Financial Account Matching is enabled in the Identity Verification product, leave this field empty to automatically match against PII collected from the Identity Verification checks.

[`legal_name`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-identity-match-request-user-legal-name)

stringstring

The user's full legal name.

[`phone_number`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-identity-match-request-user-phone-number)

stringstring

The user's phone number, in E.164 format: +{countrycode}{number}. For example: "+14157452130". Phone numbers provided in other formats will be parsed on a best-effort basis. Phone number input is validated against valid number ranges; number strings that do not match a real-world phone numbering scheme may cause the request to fail, even in the Sandbox test environment.

[`email_address`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-identity-match-request-user-email-address)

stringstring

The user's email address.

[`address`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-identity-match-request-user-address)

objectobject

Data about the components comprising an address.

[`city`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-identity-match-request-user-address-city)

stringstring

The full city name

[`region`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-identity-match-request-user-address-region)

stringstring

The region or state. In API versions 2018-05-22 and earlier, this field is called `state`.
Example: `"NC"`

[`street`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-identity-match-request-user-address-street)

stringstring

The full street address
Example: `"564 Main Street, APT 15"`

[`postal_code`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-identity-match-request-user-address-postal-code)

stringstring

The postal code. In API versions 2018-05-22 and earlier, this field is called `zip`.

[`country`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-identity-match-request-user-address-country)

stringstring

The ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code

/processor/identity/match

```
const request: ProcessorIdentityMatchRequest = {
  processor_token: processorToken,
};
const response = await plaidClient.processorIdentityMatch(request);
```

/processor/identity/match

**Response fields**

[`account`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-identity-match-response-account)

objectobject

Identity match scores for an account

[`account_id`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-identity-match-response-account-account-id)

stringstring

Plaid’s unique identifier for the account. This value will not change unless Plaid can't reconcile the account with the data returned by the financial institution. This may occur, for example, when the name of the account changes. If this happens a new `account_id` will be assigned to the account.  
The `account_id` can also change if the `access_token` is deleted and the same credentials that were used to generate that `access_token` are used to generate a new `access_token` on a later date. In that case, the new `account_id` will be different from the old `account_id`.  
If an account with a specific `account_id` disappears instead of changing, the account is likely closed. Closed accounts are not returned by the Plaid API.  
When using a CRA endpoint (an endpoint associated with Plaid Check Consumer Report, i.e. any endpoint beginning with `/cra/`), the `account_id` returned will not match the `account_id` returned by a non-CRA endpoint.  
Like all Plaid identifiers, the `account_id` is case sensitive.

[`balances`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-identity-match-response-account-balances)

objectobject

A set of fields describing the balance for an account. Balance information may be cached unless the balance object was returned by `/accounts/balance/get` or `/signal/evaluate` (using a Balance-only ruleset).

[`available`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-identity-match-response-account-balances-available)

nullablenumbernullable, number

The amount of funds available to be withdrawn from the account, as determined by the financial institution.  
For `credit`-type accounts, the `available` balance typically equals the `limit` less the `current` balance, less any pending outflows plus any pending inflows.  
For `depository`-type accounts, the `available` balance typically equals the `current` balance less any pending outflows plus any pending inflows. For `depository`-type accounts, the `available` balance does not include the overdraft limit.  
For `investment`-type accounts (or `brokerage`-type accounts for API versions 2018-05-22 and earlier), the `available` balance is the total cash available to withdraw as presented by the institution.  
Note that not all institutions calculate the `available` balance. In the event that `available` balance is unavailable, Plaid will return an `available` balance value of `null`.  
Available balance may be cached and is not guaranteed to be up-to-date in realtime unless the value was returned by `/accounts/balance/get`, or by `/signal/evaluate` with a Balance-only ruleset.  
If `current` is `null` this field is guaranteed not to be `null`.  
  

Format: `double`

[`current`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-identity-match-response-account-balances-current)

nullablenumbernullable, number

The total amount of funds in or owed by the account.  
For `credit`-type accounts, a positive balance indicates the amount owed; a negative amount indicates the lender owing the account holder.  
For `loan`-type accounts, the current balance is the principal remaining on the loan, except in the case of student loan accounts at Sallie Mae (`ins_116944`). For Sallie Mae student loans, the account's balance includes both principal and any outstanding interest. Similar to `credit`-type accounts, a positive balance is typically expected, while a negative amount indicates the lender owing the account holder.  
For `investment`-type accounts (or `brokerage`-type accounts for API versions 2018-05-22 and earlier), the current balance is the total value of assets as presented by the institution.  
Note that balance information may be cached unless the value was returned by `/accounts/balance/get` or by `/signal/evaluate` with a Balance-only ruleset; if the Item is enabled for Transactions, the balance will be at least as recent as the most recent Transaction update. If you require realtime balance information, use the `available` balance as provided by `/accounts/balance/get` or `/signal/evaluate` called with a Balance-only `ruleset_key`.  
When returned by `/accounts/balance/get`, this field may be `null`. When this happens, `available` is guaranteed not to be `null`.  
  

Format: `double`

[`limit`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-identity-match-response-account-balances-limit)

nullablenumbernullable, number

For `credit`-type accounts, this represents the credit limit.  
For `depository`-type accounts, this represents the pre-arranged overdraft limit, which is common for current (checking) accounts in Europe.  
In North America, this field is typically only available for `credit`-type accounts.  
  

Format: `double`

[`iso_currency_code`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-identity-match-response-account-balances-iso-currency-code)

nullablestringnullable, string

The ISO-4217 currency code of the balance. Always null if `unofficial_currency_code` is non-null.

[`unofficial_currency_code`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-identity-match-response-account-balances-unofficial-currency-code)

nullablestringnullable, string

The unofficial currency code associated with the balance. Always null if `iso_currency_code` is non-null. Unofficial currency codes are used for currencies that do not have official ISO currency codes, such as cryptocurrencies and the currencies of certain countries.  
See the [currency code schema](https://plaid.com/docs/api/accounts#currency-code-schema) for a full listing of supported `unofficial_currency_code`s.

[`last_updated_datetime`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-identity-match-response-account-balances-last-updated-datetime)

nullablestringnullable, string

Timestamp in [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format (`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ`) indicating the last time the balance was updated.  
This field is returned only when the institution is `ins_128026` (Capital One).  
  

Format: `date-time`

[`mask`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-identity-match-response-account-mask)

nullablestringnullable, string

The last 2-4 alphanumeric characters of either the account’s displayed mask or the account’s official account number. Note that the mask may be non-unique between an Item’s accounts.

`pending_automatic_verification`: The Item is pending automatic verification.  
`pending_manual_verification`: The Item is pending manual micro-deposit verification. Items remain in this state until the user successfully verifies the code.  
`automatically_verified`: The Item has successfully been automatically verified.  
`manually_verified`: The Item has successfully been manually verified.  
`verification_expired`: Plaid was unable to automatically verify the deposit within 7 calendar days and will no longer attempt to validate the Item. Users may retry by submitting their information again through Link.  
`verification_failed`: The Item failed manual micro-deposit verification because the user exhausted all 3 verification attempts. Users may retry by submitting their information again through Link.  
`unsent`: The Item is pending micro-deposit verification, but Plaid has not yet sent the micro-deposit.  
`database_insights_pending`: The Database Auth result is pending and will be available upon Auth request.  
`database_insights_fail`: The Item's numbers have been verified using Plaid's data sources and have signal for being invalid and/or have no signal for being valid. Typically this indicates that the routing number is invalid, the account number does not match the account number format associated with the routing number, or the account has been reported as closed or frozen. Only returned for Auth Items created via Database Auth.  
`database_insights_pass`: The Item's numbers have been verified using Plaid's data sources: the routing and account number match a routing and account number of an account recognized on the Plaid network, and the account is not known by Plaid to be frozen or closed. Only returned for Auth Items created via Database Auth.  
`database_insights_pass_with_caution`: The Item's numbers have been verified using Plaid's data sources and have some signal for being valid: the routing and account number were not recognized on the Plaid network, but the routing number is valid and the account number is a potential valid account number for that routing number. Only returned for Auth Items created via Database Auth.  
`database_matched`: (deprecated) The Item has successfully been verified using Plaid's data sources. Only returned for Auth Items created via Database Match.  
`null` or empty string: Neither micro-deposit-based verification nor database verification are being used for the Item.

stringstring

A unique and persistent identifier for accounts that can be used to trace multiple instances of the same account across different Items for depository accounts. This field is currently supported only for Items at institutions that use Tokenized Account Numbers (i.e., Chase and PNC, and in May 2025 US Bank). Because these accounts have a different account number each time they are linked, this field may be used instead of the account number to uniquely identify an account across multiple Items for payments use cases, helping to reduce duplicate Items or attempted fraud. In Sandbox, this field is populated for TAN-based institutions (`ins_56`, `ins_13`) as well as the OAuth Sandbox institution (`ins_127287`); in Production, it will only be populated for accounts at applicable institutions.

nullableobjectnullable, object

Score found by matching name provided by the API with the name on the account at the financial institution. If the account contains multiple owners, the maximum match score is filled.

[`score`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-identity-match-response-account-legal-name-score)

nullableintegernullable, integer

Match score for name. 100 is a perfect score, 99-85 means a strong match, 84-70 is a partial match, any score less than 70 is a mismatch. Typically, the match threshold should be set to a score of 70 or higher. If the name is missing from either the API or financial institution, this is null.

[`is_first_name_or_last_name_match`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-identity-match-response-account-legal-name-is-first-name-or-last-name-match)

nullablebooleannullable, boolean

Is `true` if the name on either of the names that was matched for the score contained strings indicative of a business name, such as "CORP", "LLC", "INC", or "LTD". A `true` result generally indicates that an account's name is a business name. However, a `false` result does not mean the account name is not a business name, as some businesses do not use these strings in the names used for their financial institution accounts.

[`phone_number`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-identity-match-response-account-phone-number)

nullableobjectnullable, object

Score found by matching phone number provided by the API with the phone number on the account at the financial institution. 100 is a perfect match and 0 is a no match. If the account contains multiple owners, the maximum match score is filled.

[`score`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-identity-match-response-account-phone-number-score)

nullableintegernullable, integer

Match score for normalized phone number. 100 is a perfect match, 99-70 is a partial match (matching the same phone number with extension against one without extension, etc.), anything below 70 is considered a mismatch. Typically, the match threshold should be set to a score of 70 or higher. If the phone number is missing from either the API or financial institution, this is null.

[`email_address`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-identity-match-response-account-email-address)

nullableobjectnullable, object

Score found by matching email provided by the API with the email on the account at the financial institution. 100 is a perfect match and 0 is a no match. If the account contains multiple owners, the maximum match score is filled.

[`score`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-identity-match-response-account-email-address-score)

nullableintegernullable, integer

Match score for normalized email. 100 is a perfect match, 99-70 is a partial match (matching the same email with different '+' extensions), anything below 70 is considered a mismatch.

For `depository`-type accounts, the `available` balance typically equals the `current` balance less any pending outflows plus any pending inflows. For `depository`-type accounts, the `available` balance does not include the overdraft limit.  
For `investment`-type accounts (or `brokerage`-type accounts for API versions 2018-05-22 and earlier), the `available` balance is the total cash available to withdraw as presented by the institution.  
Note that not all institutions calculate the `available` balance. In the event that `available` balance is unavailable, Plaid will return an `available` balance value of `null`.  
Available balance may be cached and is not guaranteed to be up-to-date in realtime unless the value was returned by `/accounts/balance/get`, or by `/signal/evaluate` with a Balance-only ruleset.  
If `current` is `null` this field is guaranteed not to be `null`.  
  

Format: `double`

[`current`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-investments-holdings-get-response-account-balances-current)

nullablenumbernullable, number

The total amount of funds in or owed by the account.  
For `credit`-type accounts, a positive balance indicates the amount owed; a negative amount indicates the lender owing the account holder.  
For `loan`-type accounts, the current balance is the principal remaining on the loan, except in the case of student loan accounts at Sallie Mae (`ins_116944`). For Sallie Mae student loans, the account's balance includes both principal and any outstanding interest. Similar to `credit`-type accounts, a positive balance is typically expected, while a negative amount indicates the lender owing the account holder.  
For `investment`-type accounts (or `brokerage`-type accounts for API versions 2018-05-22 and earlier), the current balance is the total value of assets as presented by the institution.  
Note that balance information may be cached unless the value was returned by `/accounts/balance/get` or by `/signal/evaluate` with a Balance-only ruleset; if the Item is enabled for Transactions, the balance will be at least as recent as the most recent Transaction update. If you require realtime balance information, use the `available` balance as provided by `/accounts/balance/get` or `/signal/evaluate` called with a Balance-only `ruleset_key`.  
When returned by `/accounts/balance/get`, this field may be `null`. When this happens, `available` is guaranteed not to be `null`.

#### `/processor/investments/transactions/get`

#### Get investment transactions data

The [`/processor/investments/transactions/get`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processorinvestmentstransactionsget) endpoint allows developers to retrieve up to 24 months of user-authorized transaction data for the investment account associated with the processor token.

Transactions are returned in reverse-chronological order, and the sequence of transaction ordering is stable and will not shift.

Due to the potentially large number of investment transactions associated with the account, results are paginated. Manipulate the count and offset parameters in conjunction with the `total_investment_transactions` response body field to fetch all available investment transactions.

Note that Investments does not have a webhook to indicate when initial transaction data has loaded (unless you use the `async_update` option). Instead, if transactions data is not ready when [`/processor/investments/transactions/get`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processorinvestmentstransactionsget) is first called, Plaid will wait for the data. For this reason, calling [`/processor/investments/transactions/get`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processorinvestmentstransactionsget) immediately after Link may take up to one to two minutes to return.

Data returned by the asynchronous investments extraction flow (when `async_update` is set to true) may not be immediately available to [`/processor/investments/transactions/get`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processorinvestmentstransactionsget). To be alerted when the data is ready to be fetched, listen for the `HISTORICAL_UPDATE` webhook. If no investments history is ready when [`/processor/investments/transactions/get`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processorinvestmentstransactionsget) is called, it will return a `PRODUCT_NOT_READY` error.

To receive Investments Transactions webhooks for a processor token, set its webhook URL via the [[`/processor/token/webhook/update`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/processor-partners/#processortokenwebhookupdate)](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processortokenwebhookupdate) endpoint.

/processor/investments/transactions/get

**Request fields**

[`client_id`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-investments-transactions-get-request-client-id)

stringstring

Your Plaid API `client_id`. The `client_id` is required and may be provided either in the `PLAID-CLIENT-ID` header or as part of a request body.

[`options`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-investments-transactions-get-request-options)

objectobject

An optional object to filter `/investments/transactions/get` results. If provided, must be non-`null`.

[`account_ids`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-investments-transactions-get-request-options-account-ids)

[string][string]

An array of `account_ids` to retrieve for the Item.

[`count`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-investments-transactions-get-request-options-count)

integerinteger

The number of transactions to fetch.  
  

Default: `100`

Minimum: `1`

Maximum: `500`

[`offset`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-investments-transactions-get-request-options-offset)

integerinteger

The number of transactions to skip when fetching transaction history  
  

Default: `0`

Minimum: `0`

[`async_update`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-investments-transactions-get-request-options-async-update)

booleanboolean

If the Item was not initialized with the investments product via the `products`, `required_if_supported_products`, or `optional_products` array when calling `/link/token/create`, and `async_update` is set to true, the initial Investments extraction will happen asynchronously. Plaid will subsequently fire a `HISTORICAL_UPDATE` webhook when the extraction completes. When `false`, Plaid will wait to return a response until extraction completion and no `HISTORICAL_UPDATE` webhook will fire. Note that while the extraction is happening asynchronously, calls to `/investments/transactions/get` and `/investments/refresh` will return `PRODUCT_NOT_READY` errors until the extraction completes.  
  

Default: `false`

[`processor_token`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-investments-transactions-get-request-processor-token)

requiredstringrequired, string

The processor token obtained from the Plaid integration partner. Processor tokens are in the format: `processor-<environment>-<identifier>`

[`secret`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-investments-transactions-get-request-secret)

stringstring

Your Plaid API `secret`. The `secret` is required and may be provided either in the `PLAID-SECRET` header or as part of a request body.

[`start_date`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-investments-transactions-get-request-start-date)

requiredstringrequired, string

The earliest date for which data should be returned. Dates should be formatted as YYYY-MM-DD.  
  

Format: `date`

[`end_date`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-investments-transactions-get-request-end-date)

requiredstringrequired, string

The latest date for which data should be returned. Dates should be formatted as YYYY-MM-DD.  
  

Format: `date`

/processor/investments/transactions/get

```
const request: ProcessorInvestmentsTransactionsGetRequest = {
  processor_token: processorToken,
};
const response = await plaidClient.processorInvestmentsTransactionsGet(request);
```

/processor/investments/transactions/get

**Response fields**

[`account`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-investments-transactions-get-response-account)

objectobject

A single account at a financial institution.

[`account_id`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-investments-transactions-get-response-account-account-id)

stringstring

Plaid’s unique identifier for the account. This value will not change unless Plaid can't reconcile the account with the data returned by the financial institution. This may occur, for example, when the name of the account changes. If this happens a new `account_id` will be assigned to the account.  
The `account_id` can also change if the `access_token` is deleted and the same credentials that were used to generate that `access_token` are used to generate a new `access_token` on a later date. In that case, the new `account_id` will be different from the old `account_id`.  
If an account with a specific `account_id` disappears instead of changing, the account is likely closed. Closed accounts are not returned by the Plaid API.  
When using a CRA endpoint (an endpoint associated with Plaid Check Consumer Report, i.e. any endpoint beginning with `/cra/`), the `account_id` returned will not match the `account_id` returned by a non-CRA endpoint.  
Like all Plaid identifiers, the `account_id` is case sensitive.

[`balances`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-investments-transactions-get-response-account-balances)

objectobject

A set of fields describing the balance for an account. Balance information may be cached unless the balance object was returned by `/accounts/balance/get` or `/signal/evaluate` (using a Balance-only ruleset).

[`available`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-investments-transactions-get-response-account-balances-available)

nullablenumbernullable, number

The amount of funds available to be withdrawn from the account, as determined by the financial institution.  
For `credit`-type accounts, the `available` balance typically equals the `limit` less the `current` balance, less any pending outflows plus any pending inflows.  
For `depository`-type accounts, the `available` balance typically equals the `current` balance less any pending outflows plus any pending inflows. For `depository`-type accounts, the `available` balance does not include the overdraft limit.  
For `investment`-type accounts (or `brokerage`-type accounts for API versions 2018-05-22 and earlier), the `available` balance is the total cash available to withdraw as presented by the institution.  
Note that not all institutions calculate the `available` balance. In the event that `available` balance is unavailable, Plaid will return an `available` balance value of `null`.  
Available balance may be cached and is not guaranteed to be up-to-date in realtime unless the value was returned by `/accounts/balance/get`, or by `/signal/evaluate` with a Balance-only ruleset.  
If `current` is `null` this field is guaranteed not to be `null`.  
  

Format: `double`

[`current`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-investments-transactions-get-response-account-balances-current)

nullablenumbernullable, number

The total amount of funds in or owed by the account.  
For `credit`-type accounts, a positive balance indicates the amount owed; a negative amount indicates the lender owing the account holder.  
For `loan`-type accounts, the current balance is the principal remaining on the loan, except in the case of student loan accounts at Sallie Mae (`ins_116944`). For Sallie Mae student loans, the account's balance includes both principal and any outstanding interest. Similar to `credit`-type accounts, a positive balance is typically expected, while a negative amount indicates the lender owing the account holder.  
For `investment`-type accounts (or `brokerage`-type accounts for API versions 2018-05-22 and earlier), the current balance is the total value of assets as presented by the institution.  
Note that balance information may be cached unless the value was returned by `/accounts/balance/get` or by `/signal/evaluate` with a Balance-only ruleset; if the Item is enabled for Transactions, the balance will be at least as recent as the most recent Transaction update. If you require realtime balance information, use the `available` balance as provided by `/accounts/balance/get` or `/signal/evaluate` called with a Balance-only `ruleset_key`.  
When returned by `/accounts/balance/get`, this field may be `null`. When this happens, `available` is guaranteed not to be `null`.  
  

Format: `double`

[`limit`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-investments-transactions-get-response-account-balances-limit)

nullablenumbernullable, number

For `credit`-type accounts, this represents the credit limit.  
For `depository`-type accounts, this represents the pre-arranged overdraft limit, which is common for current (checking) accounts in Europe.  
In North America, this field is typically only available for `credit`-type accounts.  
  

Format: `double`

[`iso_currency_code`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-investments-transactions-get-response-account-balances-iso-currency-code)

nullablestringnullable, string

The ISO-4217 currency code of the balance. Always null if `unofficial_currency_code` is non-null.

[`unofficial_currency_code`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-investments-transactions-get-response-account-balances-unofficial-currency-code)

nullablestringnullable, string

The unofficial currency code associated with the balance. Always null if `iso_currency_code` is non-null. Unofficial currency codes are used for currencies that do not have official ISO currency codes, such as cryptocurrencies and the currencies of certain countries.  
See the [currency code schema](https://plaid.com/docs/api/accounts#currency-code-schema) for a full listing of supported `unofficial_currency_code`s.

[`last_updated_datetime`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-investments-transactions-get-response-account-balances-last-updated-datetime)

nullablestringnullable, string

Timestamp in [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format (`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ`) indicating the last time the balance was updated.  
This field is returned only when the institution is `ins_128026` (Capital One).  
  

Format: `date-time`

[`mask`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-investments-transactions-get-response-account-mask)

nullablestringnullable, string

The last 2-4 alphanumeric characters of either the account’s displayed mask or the account’s official account number. Note that the mask may be non-unique between an Item’s accounts.

stringstring

The name of the account, either assigned by the user or by the financial institution itself

[`official_name`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-investments-transactions-get-response-account-official-name)

`pending_automatic_verification`: The Item is pending automatic verification.  
`pending_manual_verification`: The Item is pending manual micro-deposit verification. Items remain in this state until the user successfully verifies the code.  
`automatically_verified`: The Item has successfully been automatically verified.  
`manually_verified`: The Item has successfully been manually verified.  
`verification_expired`: Plaid was unable to automatically verify the deposit within 7 calendar days and will no longer attempt to validate the Item. Users may retry by submitting their information again through Link.  
`verification_failed`: The Item failed manual micro-deposit verification because the user exhausted all 3 verification attempts. Users may retry by submitting their information again through Link.  
`unsent`: The Item is pending micro-deposit verification, but Plaid has not yet sent the micro-deposit.  
`database_insights_pending`: The Database Auth result is pending and will be available upon Auth request.  
`database_insights_fail`: The Item's numbers have been verified using Plaid's data sources and have signal for being invalid and/or have no signal for being valid.

Only returned for Auth Items created via Database Auth.  
`database_insights_pass`: The Item's numbers have been verified using Plaid's data sources: the routing and account number match a routing and account number of an account recognized on the Plaid network, and the account is not known by Plaid to be frozen or closed. Only returned for Auth Items created via Database Auth.  
`database_insights_pass_with_caution`: The Item's numbers have been verified using Plaid's data sources and have some signal for being valid: the routing and account number were not recognized on the Plaid network, but the routing number is valid and the account number is a potential valid account number for that routing number. Only returned for Auth Items created via Database Auth.  
`database_matched`: (deprecated) The Item has successfully been verified using Plaid's data sources. Only returned for Auth Items created via Database Match.

[`persistent_account_id`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-investments-transactions-get-response-account-persistent-account-id)

stringstring

A unique and persistent identifier for accounts that can be used to trace multiple instances of the same account across different Items for depository accounts. This field is currently supported only for Items at institutions that use Tokenized Account Numbers (i.e., Chase and PNC, and in May 2025 US Bank). Because these accounts have a different account number each time they are linked, this field may be used instead of the account number to uniquely identify an account across multiple Items for payments use cases, helping to reduce duplicate Items or attempted fraud. In Sandbox, this field is populated for TAN-based institutions (`ins_56`, `ins_13`) as well as the OAuth Sandbox institution (`ins_127287`); in Production, it will only be populated for accounts at applicable institutions.

#### `/processor/signal/evaluate`

#### Evaluate a planned ACH transaction

Use [`/signal/evaluate`](/docs/api/products/signal/#signalevaluate) to evaluate a planned ACH transaction to get a return risk assessment and additional risk signals.

[`/signal/evaluate`](/docs/api/products/signal/#signalevaluate) is used with Rulesets that are configured on the end customer Dashboard can can be used with either the Signal Transaction Scores product or the Balance product. Which product is used will be determined by the `ruleset_key` that you provide. For more details, see [Signal Rules](https://plaid.com/docs/signal/signal-rules/).

Note: This request may have higher latency if Signal Transaction Scores is being added to an existing Item for the first time, or when using a Balance-only ruleset. This is because Plaid must communicate directly with the institution to request data.

#### `/processor/liabilities/get`

#### Retrieve Liabilities data

The [`/processor/liabilities/get`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processorliabilitiesget) endpoint returns various details about a loan or credit account. Liabilities data is available primarily for US financial institutions, with some limited coverage of Canadian institutions. Currently supported account types are account type `credit` with account subtype `credit card` or `paypal`, and account type `loan` with account subtype `student` or `mortgage`.

The types of information returned by Liabilities can include balances and due dates, loan terms, and account details such as original loan amount and guarantor. Data is refreshed approximately once per day; the latest data can be retrieved by calling [`/processor/liabilities/get`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processorliabilitiesget).

Note: This request may take some time to complete if `liabilities` was not specified as an initial product when creating the processor token. This is because Plaid must communicate directly with the institution to retrieve the additional data.

/processor/liabilities/get

**Request fields**

[`client_id`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-liabilities-get-request-client-id)

stringstring

Your Plaid API `client_id`. The `client_id` is required and may be provided either in the `PLAID-CLIENT-ID` header or as part of a request body.

[`secret`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-liabilities-get-request-secret)

stringstring

Your Plaid API `secret`. The `secret` is required and may be provided either in the `PLAID-SECRET` header or as part of a request body.

[`processor_token`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-liabilities-get-request-processor-token)

requiredstringrequired, string

The processor token obtained from the Plaid integration partner. Processor tokens are in the format: `processor-<environment>-<identifier>`

/processor/liabilities/get

```
const request: ProcessorLiabilitiesGetRequest = {
  processor_token: processorToken,
};
const response = await plaidClient.processorLiabilitiesGet(request);
```

/processor/liabilities/get

**Response fields**

[`account`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-liabilities-get-response-account)

objectobject

A single account at a financial institution.

[`account_id`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-liabilities-get-response-account-account-id)

stringstring

Plaid’s unique identifier for the account. This value will not change unless Plaid can't reconcile the account with the data returned by the financial institution. This may occur, for example, when the name of the account changes. If this happens a new `account_id` will be assigned to the account.  
The `account_id` can also change if the `access_token` is deleted and the same credentials that were used to generate that `access_token` are used to generate a new `access_token` on a later date. In that case, the new `account_id` will be different from the old `account_id`.  
If an account with a specific `account_id` disappears instead of changing, the account is likely closed. Closed accounts are not returned by the Plaid API.  
When using a CRA endpoint (an endpoint associated with Plaid Check Consumer Report, i.e. any endpoint beginning with `/cra/`), the `account_id` returned will not match the `account_id` returned by a non-CRA endpoint.  
Like all Plaid identifiers, the `account_id` is case sensitive.

[`balances`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-liabilities-get-response-account-balances)

objectobject

A set of fields describing the balance for an account. Balance information may be cached unless the balance object was returned by `/accounts/balance/get` or `/signal/evaluate` (using a Balance-only ruleset).

[`available`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-liabilities-get-response-account-balances-available)

nullablenumbernullable, number

The amount of funds available to be withdrawn from the account, as determined by the financial institution.  
For `credit`-type accounts, the `available` balance typically equals the `limit` less the `current` balance, less any pending outflows plus any pending inflows.  
For `depository`-type accounts, the `available` balance typically equals the `current` balance less any pending outflows plus any pending inflows. For `depository`-type accounts, the `available` balance does not include the overdraft limit.  
For `investment`-type accounts (or `brokerage`-type accounts for API versions 2018-05-22 and earlier), the `available` balance is the total cash available to withdraw as presented by the institution.  
Note that not all institutions calculate the `available` balance. In the event that `available` balance is unavailable, Plaid will return an `available` balance value of `null`.  
Available balance may be cached and is not guaranteed to be up-to-date in realtime unless the value was returned by `/accounts/balance/get`, or by `/signal/evaluate` with a Balance-only ruleset.  
If `current` is `null` this field is guaranteed not to be `null`.  
  

Format: `double`

[`current`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-liabilities-get-response-account-balances-current)

nullablenumbernullable, number

The total amount of funds in or owed by the account.  
For `credit`-type accounts, a positive balance indicates the amount owed; a negative amount indicates the lender owing the account holder.  
For `loan`-type accounts, the current balance is the principal remaining on the loan, except in the case of student loan accounts at Sallie Mae (`ins_116944`). For Sallie Mae student loans, the account's balance includes both principal and any outstanding interest. Similar to `credit`-type accounts, a positive balance is typically expected, while a negative amount indicates the lender owing the account holder.  
For `investment`-type accounts (or `brokerage`-type accounts for API versions 2018-05-22 and earlier), the current balance is the total value of assets as presented by the institution.  
Note that balance information may be cached unless the value was returned by `/accounts/balance/get` or by `/signal/evaluate` with a Balance-only ruleset; if the Item is enabled for Transactions, the balance will be at least as recent as the most recent Transaction update. If you require realtime balance information, use the `available` balance as provided by `/accounts/balance/get` or `/signal/evaluate` called with a Balance-only `ruleset_key`.  
When returned by `/accounts/balance/get`, this field may be `null`. When this happens, `available` is guaranteed not to be `null`.  
  

Format: `double`

[`limit`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-liabilities-get-response-account-balances-limit)

nullablenumbernullable, number

For `credit`-type accounts, this represents the credit limit.  
For `depository`-type accounts, this represents the pre-arranged overdraft limit, which is common for current (checking) accounts in Europe.  
In North America, this field is typically only available for `credit`-type accounts.  
  

Format: `double`

[`iso_currency_code`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-liabilities-get-response-account-balances-iso-currency-code)

nullablestringnullable, string

The ISO-4217 currency code of the balance. Always null if `unofficial_currency_code` is non-null.

[`unofficial_currency_code`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-liabilities-get-response-account-balances-unofficial-currency-code)

nullablestringnullable, string

The unofficial currency code associated with the balance. Always null if `iso_currency_code` is non-null. Unofficial currency codes are used for currencies that do not have official ISO currency codes, such as cryptocurrencies and the currencies of certain countries.  
See the [currency code schema](https://plaid.com/docs/api/accounts#currency-code-schema) for a full listing of supported `unofficial_currency_code`s.

[`last_updated_datetime`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-liabilities-get-response-account-balances-last-updated-datetime)

nullablestringnullable, string

Timestamp in [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format (`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ`) indicating the last time the balance was updated.  
This field is returned only when the institution is `ins_128026` (Capital One).  
  

Format: `date-time`

[`mask`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-liabilities-get-response-account-mask)

nullablestringnullable, string

The last 2-4 alphanumeric characters of either the account’s displayed mask or the account’s official account number. Note that the mask may be non-unique between an Item’s accounts.

`pending_automatic_verification`: The Item is pending automatic verification.  
`pending_manual_verification`: The Item is pending manual micro-deposit verification. Items remain in this state until the user successfully verifies the code.  
`automatically_verified`: The Item has successfully been automatically verified.  
`manually_verified`: The Item has successfully been manually verified.  
`verification_expired`: Plaid was unable to automatically verify the deposit within 7 calendar days and will no longer attempt to validate the Item. Users may retry by submitting their information again through Link.  
`verification_failed`: The Item failed manual micro-deposit verification because the user exhausted all 3 verification attempts. Users may retry by submitting their information again through Link.  
`unsent`: The Item is pending micro-deposit verification, but Plaid has not yet sent the micro-deposit.  
`database_insights_pending`: The Database Auth result is pending and will be available upon Auth request.  
`database_insights_fail`: The Item's numbers have been verified using Plaid's data sources and have signal for being invalid and/or have no signal for being valid. Typically this indicates that the routing number is invalid, the account number does not match the account number format associated with the routing number, or the account has been reported as closed or frozen. Only returned for Auth Items created via Database Auth.  
`database_insights_pass`: The Item's numbers have been verified using Plaid's data sources: the routing and account number match a routing and account number of an account recognized on the Plaid network, and the account is not known by Plaid to be frozen or closed. Only returned for Auth Items created via Database Auth.  
`database_insights_pass_with_caution`: The Item's numbers have been verified using Plaid's data sources and have some signal for being valid: the routing and account number were not recognized on the Plaid network, but the routing number is valid and the account number is a potential valid account number for that routing number. Only returned for Auth Items created via Database Auth.

#### `/processor/signal/decision/report`

#### Report whether you initiated an ACH transaction

After you call [`/processor/signal/evaluate`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processorsignalevaluate), Plaid will normally infer the outcome from your Signal Rules. However, if you are not using Signal Rules, if the Signal Rules outcome was `REVIEW`, or if you take a different action than the one determined by the Signal Rules, you will need to call [`/processor/signal/decision/report`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processorsignaldecisionreport). This helps improve Signal Transaction Score accuracy for your account and is necessary for proper functioning of the rule performance and rule tuning capabilities in the Dashboard. If your effective decision changes after calling [`/processor/signal/decision/report`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processorsignaldecisionreport) (for example, you indicated that you accepted a transaction, but later on, your payment processor rejected it, so it was never initiated), call [`/processor/signal/decision/report`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processorsignaldecisionreport) again for the transaction to correct Plaid's records.

If you are using Plaid Transfer as your payment processor, you also do not need to call [`/processor/signal/decision/report`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processorsignaldecisionreport), as Plaid can infer outcomes from your Transfer activity.

If using a Balance-only ruleset, this endpoint will not impact scores (Balance does not use scores), but is necessary to view accurate transaction outcomes and tune rule logic in the Dashboard.

#### `/processor/signal/return/report`

#### Report a return for an ACH transaction

Call the [`/processor/signal/return/report`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processorsignalreturnreport) endpoint to report a returned transaction that was previously sent to the [`/processor/signal/evaluate`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processorsignalevaluate) endpoint. Your feedback will be used by the model to incorporate the latest risk trend in your portfolio.

If you are using the [Plaid Transfer product](https://plaid.com/docs/transfer) to create transfers, it is not necessary to use this endpoint, as Plaid already knows whether the transfer was returned.

#### `/processor/transactions/sync`

#### Get incremental transaction updates on a processor token

The [`/processor/transactions/sync`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processortransactionssync) endpoint retrieves transactions associated with an Item and can fetch updates using a cursor to track which updates have already been seen.

For important instructions on integrating with [`/processor/transactions/sync`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processortransactionssync), see the [Transactions integration overview](https://plaid.com/docs/transactions/#integration-overview). If you are migrating from an existing integration using [`/processor/transactions/get`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processortransactionsget), see the [Transactions Sync migration guide](https://plaid.com/docs/transactions/sync-migration/).

This endpoint supports `credit`, `depository`, and some `loan`-type accounts (only those with account subtype `student`). For `investments` accounts, use [`/investments/transactions/get`](/docs/api/products/investments/#investmentstransactionsget) instead.

When retrieving paginated updates, track both the `next_cursor` from the latest response and the original cursor from the first call in which `has_more` was `true`; if a call to [`/processor/transactions/sync`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processortransactionssync) fails when retrieving a paginated update (e.g due to the [`TRANSACTIONS_SYNC_MUTATION_DURING_PAGINATION`](https://plaid.com/docs/errors/transactions/#transactions_sync_mutation_during_pagination) error), the entire pagination request loop must be restarted beginning with the cursor for the first page of the update, rather than retrying only the single request that failed.

If transactions data is not yet available for the Item, which can happen if the Item was not initialized with transactions during the [`/link/token/create`](/docs/api/link/#linktokencreate) call or if [`/processor/transactions/sync`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processortransactionssync) was called within a few seconds of Item creation, [`/processor/transactions/sync`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processortransactionssync) will return empty transactions arrays.

Plaid typically checks for new transactions data between one and four times per day, depending on the institution. To find out when transactions were last updated for an Item, use the [Item Debugger](https://plaid.com/docs/account/activity/#troubleshooting-with-item-debugger) or call [`/item/get`](/docs/api/items/#itemget); the `item.status.transactions.last_successful_update` field will show the timestamp of the most recent successful update. To force Plaid to check for new transactions, use the [`/processor/transactions/refresh`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processortransactionsrefresh) endpoint.

To be alerted when new transactions are available, listen for the [`SYNC_UPDATES_AVAILABLE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#sync_updates_available) webhook.

To receive Transactions webhooks for a processor token, set its webhook URL via the [[`/processor/token/webhook/update`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/processor-partners/#processortokenwebhookupdate)](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processortokenwebhookupdate) endpoint.

/processor/transactions/sync

**Request fields**

[`client_id`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-transactions-sync-request-client-id)

stringstring

Your Plaid API `client_id`. The `client_id` is required and may be provided either in the `PLAID-CLIENT-ID` header or as part of a request body.

[`processor_token`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-transactions-sync-request-processor-token)

requiredstringrequired, string

The processor token obtained from the Plaid integration partner. Processor tokens are in the format: `processor-<environment>-<identifier>`

[`secret`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-transactions-sync-request-secret)

stringstring

Your Plaid API `secret`. The `secret` is required and may be provided either in the `PLAID-SECRET` header or as part of a request body.

[`cursor`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-transactions-sync-request-cursor)

stringstring

The cursor value represents the last update requested. Providing it will cause the response to only return changes after this update.
If omitted, the entire history of updates will be returned, starting with the first-added transactions on the item.
Note: The upper-bound length of this cursor is 256 characters of base64.

[`count`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-transactions-sync-request-count)

integerinteger

The number of transaction updates to fetch.  
  

Default: `100`

Minimum: `1`

Maximum: `500`

Exclusive min: `false`

[`options`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-transactions-sync-request-options)

objectobject

An optional object to be used with the request. If specified, `options` must not be `null`.

[`include_original_description`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-transactions-sync-request-options-include-original-description)

booleanboolean

Include the raw unparsed transaction description from the financial institution.  
  

Default: `false`

[`personal_finance_category_version`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-transactions-sync-request-options-personal-finance-category-version)

stringstring

Indicates which version of the personal finance category taxonomy is being used. [View PFCv2 and PFCv1 taxonomies](https://plaid.com/documents/pfc-taxonomy-all.csv).  
If you enabled Transactions or Enrich before December 2025 you will receive the `v1` taxonomy by default and may request `v2` by explicitly setting this field to `v2` in the request.  
If you enabled Transactions or Enrich on or after December 2025, you may only receive the `v2` taxonomy.  
  

Possible values: `v1`, `v2`

[`days_requested`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-transactions-sync-request-options-days-requested)

integerinteger

This field only applies to calls for Items where the Transactions product has not already been initialized (i.e., by specifying `transactions` in the `products`, `required_if_supported_products`, or `optional_products` array when calling `/link/token/create` or by making a previous call to `/transactions/sync` or `/transactions/get`). In those cases, the field controls the maximum number of days of transaction history that Plaid will request from the financial institution. The more transaction history is requested, the longer the historical update poll will take. If no value is specified, 90 days of history will be requested by default. In Production, if a value less than 30 is provided, a minimum of 30 days of transaction history will be requested.  
If you are initializing your Items with transactions during the `/link/token/create` call (e.g. by including `transactions` in the `/link/token/create` `products` array), you must use the [`transactions.days_requested`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/link/#link-token-create-request-transactions-days-requested) field in the `/link/token/create` request instead of in the `/transactions/sync` request.  
If the Item has already been initialized with the Transactions product, this field will have no effect. The maximum amount of transaction history to request on an Item cannot be updated if Transactions has already been added to the Item. To request older transaction history on an Item where Transactions has already been added, you must delete the Item via `/item/remove` and send the user through Link to create a new Item.  
Customers using [Recurring Transactions](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactionsrecurringget) should request at least 180 days of history for optimal results.  
  

Minimum: `1`

Maximum: `730`

Default: `90`

[`account_id`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-transactions-sync-request-options-account-id)

stringstring

If provided, the returned updates and cursor will only reflect the specified account's transactions. Omitting `account_id` returns updates for all accounts under the Item. Note that specifying an `account_id` effectively creates a separate incremental update stream—and therefore a separate cursor—for that account. If multiple accounts are queried this way, you will maintain multiple cursors, one per `account_id`.  
If you decide to begin filtering by `account_id` after using no `account_id`, start fresh with a null cursor and maintain separate `(account_id, cursor)` pairs going forward. Do not reuse any previously saved cursors, as this can cause pagination errors or incomplete data.  
Note: An error will be returned if a provided `account_id` is not associated with the Item.

/processor/transactions/sync

```
// Provide a cursor from your database if you've previously
// received one for the Item. Leave null if this is your
// first sync call for this Item. The first request will
// return a cursor.
let cursor = database.getLatestCursorOrNull(itemId);

// New transaction updates since "cursor"
let added: Array<Transaction> = [];
let modified: Array<Transaction> = [];
// Removed transaction ids
let removed: Array<RemovedTransaction> = [];
let hasMore = true;

// Iterate through each page of new transaction updates for item
while (hasMore) {
  const request: ProcessorTransactionsSyncRequest = {
    processor_token: processorToken,
    cursor: cursor,
  };
  const response = await client.processorTransactionsSync(request);
  const data = response.data;

  // Add this page of results
  added = added.concat(data.added);
  modified = modified.concat(data.modified);
  removed = removed.concat(data.removed);

  hasMore = data.has_more;

  // Update cursor to the next cursor
  cursor = data.next_cursor;
}

// Persist cursor and updated data
database.applyUpdates(itemId, added, modified, removed, cursor);
```

/processor/transactions/sync

**Response fields**

[`transactions_update_status`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-transactions-sync-response-transactions-update-status)

stringstring

A description of the update status for transaction pulls of an Item. This field contains the same information provided by transactions webhooks, and may be helpful for webhook troubleshooting or when recovering from missed webhooks.  
`TRANSACTIONS_UPDATE_STATUS_UNKNOWN`: Unable to fetch transactions update status for Item.
`NOT_READY`: The Item is pending transaction pull.
`INITIAL_UPDATE_COMPLETE`: Initial pull for the Item is complete, historical pull is pending.
`HISTORICAL_UPDATE_COMPLETE`: Both initial and historical pull for Item are complete.  
  

Possible values: `TRANSACTIONS_UPDATE_STATUS_UNKNOWN`, `NOT_READY`, `INITIAL_UPDATE_COMPLETE`, `HISTORICAL_UPDATE_COMPLETE`

[`account`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-transactions-sync-response-account)

nullableobjectnullable, object

A single account at a financial institution.

[`account_id`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-transactions-sync-response-account-account-id)

stringstring

Plaid’s unique identifier for the account. This value will not change unless Plaid can't reconcile the account with the data returned by the financial institution. This may occur, for example, when the name of the account changes. If this happens a new `account_id` will be assigned to the account.  
The `account_id` can also change if the `access_token` is deleted and the same credentials that were used to generate that `access_token` are used to generate a new `access_token` on a later date. In that case, the new `account_id` will be different from the old `account_id`.  
If an account with a specific `account_id` disappears instead of changing, the account is likely closed. Closed accounts are not returned by the Plaid API.  
When using a CRA endpoint (an endpoint associated with Plaid Check Consumer Report, i.e. any endpoint beginning with `/cra/`), the `account_id` returned will not match the `account_id` returned by a non-CRA endpoint.  
Like all Plaid identifiers, the `account_id` is case sensitive.

[`balances`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-transactions-sync-response-account-balances)

objectobject

A set of fields describing the balance for an account. Balance information may be cached unless the balance object was returned by `/accounts/balance/get` or `/signal/evaluate` (using a Balance-only ruleset).

[`available`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-transactions-sync-response-account-balances-available)

nullablenumbernullable, number

The amount of funds available to be withdrawn from the account, as determined by the financial institution.  
For `credit`-type accounts, the `available` balance typically equals the `limit` less the `current` balance, less any pending outflows plus any pending inflows.  
For `depository`-type accounts, the `available` balance typically equals the `current` balance less any pending outflows plus any pending inflows. For `depository`-type accounts, the `available` balance does not include the overdraft limit.  
For `investment`-type accounts (or `brokerage`-type accounts for API versions 2018-05-22 and earlier), the `available` balance is the total cash available to withdraw as presented by the institution.  
Note that not all institutions calculate the `available` balance. In the event that `available` balance is unavailable, Plaid will return an `available` balance value of `null`.  
Available balance may be cached and is not guaranteed to be up-to-date in realtime unless the value was returned by `/accounts/balance/get`, or by `/signal/evaluate` with a Balance-only ruleset.  
If `current` is `null` this field is guaranteed not to be `null`.  
  

Format: `double`

[`current`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-transactions-sync-response-account-balances-current)

nullablenumbernullable, number

The total amount of funds in or owed by the account.  
For `credit`-type accounts, a positive balance indicates the amount owed; a negative amount indicates the lender owing the account holder.  
For `loan`-type accounts, the current balance is the principal remaining on the loan, except in the case of student loan accounts at Sallie Mae (`ins_116944`). For Sallie Mae student loans, the account's balance includes both principal and any outstanding interest. Similar to `credit`-type accounts, a positive balance is typically expected, while a negative amount indicates the lender owing the account holder.  
For `investment`-type accounts (or `brokerage`-type accounts for API versions 2018-05-22 and earlier), the current balance is the total value of assets as presented by the institution.  
Note that balance information may be cached unless the value was returned by `/accounts/balance/get` or by `/signal/evaluate` with a Balance-only ruleset; if the Item is enabled for Transactions, the balance will be at least as recent as the most recent Transaction update. If you require realtime balance information, use the `available` balance as provided by `/accounts/balance/get` or `/signal/evaluate` called with a Balance-only `ruleset_key`.  
When returned by `/accounts/balance/get`, this field may be `null`. When this happens, `available` is guaranteed not to be `null`.  
  

Format: `double`

[`limit`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-transactions-sync-response-account-balances-limit)

nullablenumbernullable, number

For `credit`-type accounts, this represents the credit limit.  
For `depository`-type accounts, this represents the pre-arranged overdraft limit, which is common for current (checking) accounts in Europe.  
In North America, this field is typically only available for `credit`-type accounts.  
  

Format: `double`

[`iso_currency_code`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-transactions-sync-response-account-balances-iso-currency-code)

nullablestringnullable, string

The ISO-4217 currency code of the balance. Always null if `unofficial_currency_code` is non-null.

[`unofficial_currency_code`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-transactions-sync-response-account-balances-unofficial-currency-code)

nullablestringnullable, string

The unofficial currency code associated with the balance. Always null if `iso_currency_code` is non-null. Unofficial currency codes are used for currencies that do not have official ISO currency codes, such as cryptocurrencies and the currencies of certain countries.  
See the [currency code schema](https://plaid.com/docs/api/accounts#currency-code-schema) for a full listing of supported `unofficial_currency_code`s.

[`last_updated_datetime`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-transactions-sync-response-account-balances-last-updated-datetime)

nullablestringnullable, string

Timestamp in [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format (`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ`) indicating the last time the balance was updated.  
This field is returned only when the institution is `ins_128026` (Capital One).  
  

Format: `date-time`

[`mask`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-transactions-sync-response-account-mask)

nullablestringnullable, string

The last 2-4 alphanumeric characters of either the account’s displayed mask or the account’s official account number. Note that the mask may be non-unique between an Item’s accounts.

[`name`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-transactions-sync-response-account-name)

[`verification_status`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-transactions-sync-response-account-verification-status)

stringstring

Indicates an Item's micro-deposit-based verification or database verification status. This field is only populated when using Auth and falling back to micro-deposit or database verification. Possible values are:  
`pending_automatic_verification`: The Item is pending automatic verification.  
`pending_manual_verification`: The Item is pending manual micro-deposit verification. Items remain in this state until the user successfully verifies the code.  
`automatically_verified`: The Item has successfully been automatically verified.  
`manually_verified`: The Item has successfully been manually verified.  
`verification_expired`: Plaid was unable to automatically verify the deposit within 7 calendar days and will no longer attempt to validate the Item. Users may retry by submitting their information again through Link.  
`verification_failed`: The Item failed manual micro-deposit verification because the user exhausted all 3 verification attempts. Users may retry by submitting their information again through Link.  
`unsent`: The Item is pending micro-deposit verification, but Plaid has not yet sent the micro-deposit.  
`database_insights_pending`: The Database Auth result is pending and will be available upon Auth request.  
`database_insights_fail`: The Item's numbers have been verified using Plaid's data sources and have signal for being invalid and/or have no signal for being valid. Typically this indicates that the routing number is invalid, the account number does not match the account number format associated with the routing number, or the account has been reported as closed or frozen. Only returned for Auth Items created via Database Auth.

#### `/processor/transactions/get`

#### Get transaction data

The [`/processor/transactions/get`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processortransactionsget) endpoint allows developers to receive user-authorized transaction data for credit, depository, and some loan-type accounts (only those with account subtype `student`; coverage may be limited). Transaction data is standardized across financial institutions, and in many cases transactions are linked to a clean name, entity type, location, and category. Similarly, account data is standardized and returned with a clean name, number, balance, and other meta information where available.

Transactions are returned in reverse-chronological order, and the sequence of transaction ordering is stable and will not shift. Transactions are not immutable and can also be removed altogether by the institution; a removed transaction will no longer appear in [`/processor/transactions/get`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processortransactionsget). For more details, see [Pending and posted transactions](https://plaid.com/docs/transactions/transactions-data/#pending-and-posted-transactions).

Due to the potentially large number of transactions associated with a processor token, results are paginated. Manipulate the `count` and `offset` parameters in conjunction with the `total_transactions` response body field to fetch all available transactions.

Data returned by [`/processor/transactions/get`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processortransactionsget) will be the data available for the processor token as of the most recent successful check for new transactions. Plaid typically checks for new data multiple times a day, but these checks may occur less frequently, such as once a day, depending on the institution. To force Plaid to check for new transactions, you can use the [`/processor/transactions/refresh`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processortransactionsrefresh) endpoint.

Note that data may not be immediately available to [`/processor/transactions/get`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processortransactionsget). Plaid will begin to prepare transactions data upon Item link, if Link was initialized with `transactions`, or upon the first call to [`/processor/transactions/get`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processortransactionsget), if it wasn't. If no transaction history is ready when [`/processor/transactions/get`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processortransactionsget) is called, it will return a `PRODUCT_NOT_READY` error.

To receive Transactions webhooks for a processor token, set its webhook URL via the [[`/processor/token/webhook/update`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/processor-partners/#processortokenwebhookupdate)](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processortokenwebhookupdate) endpoint.

/processor/transactions/get

**Response fields**

[`account`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-transactions-get-response-account)

objectobject

A single account at a financial institution.

[`account_id`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-transactions-get-response-account-account-id)

stringstring

Plaid’s unique identifier for the account. This value will not change unless Plaid can't reconcile the account with the data returned by the financial institution. This may occur, for example, when the name of the account changes. If this happens a new `account_id` will be assigned to the account.  
The `account_id` can also change if the `access_token` is deleted and the same credentials that were used to generate that `access_token` are used to generate a new `access_token` on a later date. In that case, the new `account_id` will be different from the old `account_id`.  
If an account with a specific `account_id` disappears instead of changing, the account is likely closed. Closed accounts are not returned by the Plaid API.  
When using a CRA endpoint (an endpoint associated with Plaid Check Consumer Report, i.e. any endpoint beginning with `/cra/`), the `account_id` returned will not match the `account_id` returned by a non-CRA endpoint.  
Like all Plaid identifiers, the `account_id` is case sensitive.

[`balances`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-transactions-get-response-account-balances)

objectobject

A set of fields describing the balance for an account. Balance information may be cached unless the balance object was returned by `/accounts/balance/get` or `/signal/evaluate` (using a Balance-only ruleset).

[`available`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-transactions-get-response-account-balances-available)

nullablenumbernullable, number

The amount of funds available to be withdrawn from the account, as determined by the financial institution.  
For `credit`-type accounts, the `available` balance typically equals the `limit` less the `current` balance, less any pending outflows plus any pending inflows.  
For `depository`-type accounts, the `available` balance typically equals the `current` balance less any pending outflows plus any pending inflows. For `depository`-type accounts, the `available` balance does not include the overdraft limit.  
For `investment`-type accounts (or `brokerage`-type accounts for API versions 2018-05-22 and earlier), the `available` balance is the total cash available to withdraw as presented by the institution.  
Note that not all institutions calculate the `available` balance. In the event that `available` balance is unavailable, Plaid will return an `available` balance value of `null`.  
Available balance may be cached and is not guaranteed to be up-to-date in realtime unless the value was returned by `/accounts/balance/get`, or by `/signal/evaluate` with a Balance-only ruleset.  
If `current` is `null` this field is guaranteed not to be `null`.  
  

Format: `double`

[`current`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-transactions-get-response-account-balances-current)

nullablenumbernullable, number

The total amount of funds in or owed by the account.  
For `credit`-type accounts, a positive balance indicates the amount owed; a negative amount indicates the lender owing the account holder.  
For `loan`-type accounts, the current balance is the principal remaining on the loan, except in the case of student loan accounts at Sallie Mae (`ins_116944`). For Sallie Mae student loans, the account's balance includes both principal and any outstanding interest. Similar to `credit`-type accounts, a positive balance is typically expected, while a negative amount indicates the lender owing the account holder.  
For `investment`-type accounts (or `brokerage`-type accounts for API versions 2018-05-22 and earlier), the current balance is the total value of assets as presented by the institution.  
Note that balance information may be cached unless the value was returned by `/accounts/balance/get` or by `/signal/evaluate` with a Balance-only ruleset; if the Item is enabled for Transactions, the balance will be at least as recent as the most recent Transaction update. If you require realtime balance information, use the `available` balance as provided by `/accounts/balance/get` or `/signal/evaluate` called with a Balance-only `ruleset_key`.  
When returned by `/accounts/balance/get`, this field may be `null`. When this happens, `available` is guaranteed not to be `null`.  
  

Format: `double`

[`limit`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-transactions-get-response-account-balances-limit)

nullablenumbernullable, number

For `credit`-type accounts, this represents the credit limit.  
For `depository`-type accounts, this represents the pre-arranged overdraft limit, which is common for current (checking) accounts in Europe.  
In North America, this field is typically only available for `credit`-type accounts.  
  

Format: `double`

[`iso_currency_code`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-transactions-get-response-account-balances-iso-currency-code)

nullablestringnullable, string

The ISO-4217 currency code of the balance. Always null if `unofficial_currency_code` is non-null.

[`unofficial_currency_code`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-transactions-get-response-account-balances-unofficial-currency-code)

nullablestringnullable, string

The unofficial currency code associated with the balance. Always null if `iso_currency_code` is non-null. Unofficial currency codes are used for currencies that do not have official ISO currency codes, such as cryptocurrencies and the currencies of certain countries.  
See the [currency code schema](https://plaid.com/docs/api/accounts#currency-code-schema) for a full listing of supported `unofficial_currency_code`s.

[`last_updated_datetime`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-transactions-get-response-account-balances-last-updated-datetime)

nullablestringnullable, string

Timestamp in [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format (`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ`) indicating the last time the balance was updated.  
This field is returned only when the institution is `ins_128026` (Capital One).  
  

Format: `date-time`

[`mask`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-transactions-get-response-account-mask)

[`verification_status`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-transactions-get-response-account-verification-status)

stringstring

Indicates an Item's micro-deposit-based verification or database verification status. This field is only populated when using Auth and falling back to micro-deposit or database verification. Possible values are:  
`pending_automatic_verification`: The Item is pending automatic verification.  
`pending_manual_verification`: The Item is pending manual micro-deposit verification. Items remain in this state until the user successfully verifies the code.  
`automatically_verified`: The Item has successfully been automatically verified.  
`manually_verified`: The Item has successfully been manually verified.  
`verification_expired`: Plaid was unable to automatically verify the deposit within 7 calendar days and will no longer attempt to validate the Item. Users may retry by submitting their information again through Link.  
`verification_failed`: The Item failed manual micro-deposit verification because the user exhausted all 3 verification attempts. Users may retry by submitting their information again through Link.  
`unsent`: The Item is pending micro-deposit verification, but Plaid has not yet sent the micro-deposit.  
`database_insights_pending`: The Database Auth result is pending and will be available upon Auth request.  
`database_insights_fail`: The Item's numbers have been verified using Plaid's data sources and have signal for being invalid and/or have no signal for being valid. Typically this indicates that the routing number is invalid, the account number does not match the account number format associated with the routing number, or the account has been reported as closed or frozen. Only returned for Auth Items created via Database Auth.  
`database_insights_pass`: The Item's numbers have been verified using Plaid's data sources: the routing and account number match a routing and account number of an account recognized on the Plaid network, and the account is not known by Plaid to be frozen or closed. Only returned for Auth Items created via Database Auth.  
`database_insights_pass_with_caution`: The Item's numbers have been verified using Plaid's data sources and have some signal for being valid: the routing and account number were not recognized on the Plaid network, but the routing number is valid and the account number is a potential valid account number for that routing number. Only returned for Auth Items created via Database Auth.  
`database_matched`: (deprecated) The Item has successfully been verified using Plaid's data sources. Only returned for Auth Items created via Database Match.  
`null` or empty string: Neither micro-deposit-based verification nor database verification are being used for the Item.

If defined, will be a value between 0 and 100. Will be undefined if name matching was not enabled for the database verification session or if there were no eligible Plaid network matches to compare the given name with.

[`network_status`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-transactions-get-response-account-verification-insights-network-status)

objectobject

Status information about the account and routing number in the Plaid network.

[`has_numbers_match`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-transactions-get-response-account-verification-insights-network-status-has-numbers-match)

A unique and persistent identifier for accounts that can be used to trace multiple instances of the same account across different Items for depository accounts. This field is currently supported only for Items at institutions that use Tokenized Account Numbers (i.e., Chase and PNC, and in May 2025 US Bank). Because these accounts have a different account number each time they are linked, this field may be used instead of the account number to uniquely identify an account across multiple Items for payments use cases, helping to reduce duplicate Items or attempted fraud. In Sandbox, this field is populated for TAN-based institutions (`ins_56`, `ins_13`) as well as the OAuth Sandbox institution (`ins_127287`); in Production, it will only be populated for accounts at applicable institutions.

[`holder_category`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-transactions-get-response-account-holder-category)

Format: `date`

[`location`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-transactions-get-response-transactions-location)

objectobject

A representation of where a transaction took place. Location data is provided only for transactions at physical locations, not for online transactions. Location data availability depends primarily on the merchant and is most likely to be populated for transactions at large retail chains; small, local businesses are less likely to have location data available.

deprecatedstringdeprecated, string

The merchant name or transaction description.  
Note: While Plaid does not currently plan to remove this field, it is a legacy field that is not actively maintained. Use `merchant_name` instead for the merchant name.  
If the `transactions` object was returned by a Transactions endpoint such as `/transactions/sync` or `/transactions/get`, this field will always appear. If the `transactions` object was returned by an Assets endpoint such as `/asset_report/get/` or `/asset_report/pdf/get`, this field will only appear in an Asset Report with Insights.

[`original_description`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-transactions-get-response-transactions-original-description)

nullablestringnullable, string

The string returned by the financial institution to describe the transaction. For transactions returned by `/transactions/sync` or `/transactions/get`, this field will only be included if the client has set `options.include_original_description` to `true`.

[`payment_meta`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-transactions-get-response-transactions-payment-meta)

objectobject

Transaction information specific to inter-bank transfers. If the transaction was not an inter-bank transfer, all fields will be `null`.  
If the `transactions` object was returned by a Transactions endpoint such as `/transactions/sync` or `/transactions/get`, the `payment_meta` key will always appear, but no data elements are guaranteed. If the `transactions` object was returned by an Assets endpoint such as `/asset_report/get/` or `/asset_report/pdf/get`, this field will only appear in an Asset Report with Insights.

[`account_owner`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processor-transactions-get-response-transactions-account-owner)

nullablestringnullable, string

This field is not typically populated and only relevant when dealing with sub-accounts.

#### `/processor/transactions/recurring/get`

#### Fetch recurring transaction streams

The [`/processor/transactions/recurring/get`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processortransactionsrecurringget) endpoint allows developers to receive a summary of the recurring outflow and inflow streams (expenses and deposits) from a user’s checking, savings or credit card accounts. Additionally, Plaid provides key insights about each recurring stream including the category, merchant, last amount, and more. Developers can use these insights to build tools and experiences that help their users better manage cash flow, monitor subscriptions, reduce spend, and stay on track with bill payments.

This endpoint is offered as an add-on to Transactions. To request access to this endpoint, submit a [product access request](https://dashboard.plaid.com/team/products) or contact your Plaid account manager.

This endpoint can only be called on a processor token that has already been initialized with Transactions (either during Link, by specifying it in [`/link/token/create`](/docs/api/link/#linktokencreate); or after Link, by calling [`/processor/transactions/get`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processortransactionsget) or [`/processor/transactions/sync`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processortransactionssync)). Once all historical transactions have been fetched, call [`/processor/transactions/recurring/get`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processortransactionsrecurringget) to receive the Recurring Transactions streams and subscribe to the [`RECURRING_TRANSACTIONS_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#recurring_transactions_update) webhook. To know when historical transactions have been fetched, if you are using [`/processor/transactions/sync`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processortransactionssync) listen for the [`SYNC_UPDATES_AVAILABLE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#SyncUpdatesAvailableWebhook-historical-update-complete) webhook and check that the `historical_update_complete` field in the payload is `true`. If using [`/processor/transactions/get`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processortransactionsget), listen for the [`HISTORICAL_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#historical_update) webhook.

After the initial call, you can call [`/processor/transactions/recurring/get`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processortransactionsrecurringget) endpoint at any point in the future to retrieve the latest summary of recurring streams. Listen to the [`RECURRING_TRANSACTIONS_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#recurring_transactions_update) webhook to be notified when new updates are available.

To receive Transactions webhooks for a processor token, set its webhook URL via the [[`/processor/token/webhook/update`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/processor-partners/#processortokenwebhookupdate)](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processortokenwebhookupdate) endpoint.

#### `/processor/transactions/refresh`

#### Refresh transaction data

[`/processor/transactions/refresh`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processortransactionsrefresh) is an optional endpoint for users of the Transactions product. It initiates an on-demand extraction to fetch the newest transactions for a processor token. This on-demand extraction takes place in addition to the periodic extractions that automatically occur one or more times per day for any Transactions-enabled processor token. If changes to transactions are discovered after calling [`/processor/transactions/refresh`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processortransactionsrefresh), Plaid will fire a webhook: for [`/transactions/sync`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactionssync) users, [`SYNC_UPDATES_AVAILABLE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#sync_updates_available) will be fired if there are any transactions updated, added, or removed. For users of both [`/processor/transactions/sync`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processortransactionssync) and [`/processor/transactions/get`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processortransactionsget), [`TRANSACTIONS_REMOVED`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactions_removed) will be fired if any removed transactions are detected, and [`DEFAULT_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#default_update) will be fired if any new transactions are detected. New transactions can be fetched by calling [`/processor/transactions/get`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processortransactionsget) or [`/processor/transactions/sync`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processortransactionssync). Note that the [`/transactions/refresh`](/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactionsrefresh) endpoint is not supported for Capital One (`ins_128026`) non-depository accounts and will result in a `PRODUCTS_NOT_SUPPORTED` error if called on an Item that contains only non-depository accounts from that institution.

As this endpoint triggers a synchronous request for fresh data, latency may be higher than for other Plaid endpoints (typically less than 10 seconds, but occasionally up to 30 seconds or more); if you encounter errors, you may find it necessary to adjust your timeout period when making requests.

[`/processor/transactions/refresh`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processortransactionsrefresh) is offered as an add-on to Transactions and has a separate [fee model](https://plaid.com/docs/account/billing/#per-request-flat-fee). To request access to this endpoint, submit a [product access request](https://dashboard.plaid.com/team/products) or contact your Plaid account manager.

#### `WEBHOOK_UPDATE_ACKNOWLEDGED`

This webhook is only sent to [Plaid processor partners](https://plaid.com/docs/auth/partnerships/).

Fired when a processor updates the webhook URL for a processor token via [`/processor/token/webhook/update`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#processortokenwebhookupdate).

[`error`](/docs/api/processor-partners/#ProcessorTokenWebhookUpdate-error)

objectobject

Errors are identified by `error_code` and categorized by `error_type`. Use these in preference to HTTP status codes to identify and handle specific errors. HTTP status codes are set and provide the broadest categorization of errors: 4xx codes are for developer- or user-related errors, and 5xx codes are for Plaid-related errors, and the status will be 2xx in non-error cases. An Item with a non-`null` error object will only be part of an API response when calling `/item/get` to view Item status. Otherwise, error fields will be `null` if no error has occurred; if an error has occurred, an error code will be returned instead.
